# UVToolkit for Blender

## Synopsis
This repository is a re-upload of UV Toolkit, a paid Blender add-on originally created by Alexander Belyakov. Unfortunately, the add-on is no longer available for purchase through online stores, making arguably one of the best generic UV add-ons inaccessible to new users.

Version 2.1.0 of UV Toolkit was the latest version we had access to, if there are any newer versions known do feel free to submit it as a pull request or reach out to ethan.simon.3d@gmail.com for it to be implemented.

Ethan note: As a tool dev I am entirely qualified to maintain any bug reports, pull requests, or otherwise sent in but it's unlikely that I'll be making any improvements or new additions to the tools functionality. This page ultimately exists for archival reasons.

## Acknowledgements
Please note that this repository may be removed or made private if/when Alex reinstates their storefronts, as the aim of this page is not to undermine the paid nature of the add-on but rather to provide a tool no longer accessible through conventional methods. Additionally, this repository is well within the rights of GPL licensing to be created, but as stated earlier respect to the tool developer will be upheld in the event of the store pages returning. All help, resource, and original store page links for this tool can be found within the `Help/Links` tab in the add-on preferences after installing.
