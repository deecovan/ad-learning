00:00:00,480 --> 00:00:03,160
what's up guys justin here with the

2
00:00:03,160 --> 00:00:04,880
cgessentials.com back with another

3
00:00:04,880 --> 00:00:07,040
blender rendering tutorial for you

4
00:00:07,040 --> 00:00:08,720
so in today's video we're going to check

5
00:00:08,720 --> 00:00:10,880
out how to use freestyle in order to

6
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,920
render out the

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:14,480
edges so they actually show up inside

8
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:15,360
your renders

9
00:00:15,360 --> 00:00:16,880
in blender so let's go ahead and get

10
00:00:16,880 --> 00:00:18,640
started alright so i will link to the

11
00:00:18,640 --> 00:00:20,560
information about freestyle

12
00:00:20,560 --> 00:00:23,039
in the blender documentation so that you

13
00:00:23,039 --> 00:00:24,640
can check that out and take a look but

14
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:25,920
in this video we're going to

15
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:28,720
start by looking at how to render out

16
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:29,679
our image

17
00:00:29,679 --> 00:00:32,800
with different line styles so

18
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,719
first things first if we were to render

19
00:00:34,719 --> 00:00:36,880
this right now so if we just render the

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:38,320
image it's going to look something like

21
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:38,960
this

22
00:00:38,960 --> 00:00:41,360
right so depending on if you have ev

23
00:00:41,360 --> 00:00:43,200
activated or cycles you might get some

24
00:00:43,200 --> 00:00:44,559
shadows in here

25
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:47,120
but you can see how right now um this is

26
00:00:47,120 --> 00:00:48,879
a very kind of blocky shape

27
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:51,039
with not a lot of definition what we

28
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,239
might want to do is we might want to

29
00:00:52,239 --> 00:00:53,760
come in here and render this out

30
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:56,559
so that the edges actually show up as

31
00:00:56,559 --> 00:00:57,199
lines

32
00:00:57,199 --> 00:00:58,879
in our rendering and so the way that

33
00:00:58,879 --> 00:01:00,719
we're going to do that is we're going to

34
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:01,440
jump over

35
00:01:01,440 --> 00:01:04,400
into our let's see we're going to jump

36
00:01:04,400 --> 00:01:06,880
over into our render properties

37
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:08,640
and so the easiest way to start adding

38
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,720
freestyle is just to come down here

39
00:01:10,720 --> 00:01:13,360
and just check the box for freestyle and

40
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,360
so when we activate freestyle

41
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:16,799
if we run a render so i'm just going to

42
00:01:16,799 --> 00:01:19,200
tap f12 in order to do this

43
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:20,320
you can see how you're going to get a

44
00:01:20,320 --> 00:01:22,960
rendering in here that now has

45
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:25,200
edges highlighted inside of our

46
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,000
rendering

47
00:01:26,000 --> 00:01:27,840
so you can use this to quickly add those

48
00:01:27,840 --> 00:01:30,000
edges inside of your scenes

49
00:01:30,000 --> 00:01:32,880
so now let's take a look at this if we

50
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,040
were to adjust the line thickness

51
00:01:35,040 --> 00:01:36,320
so i'm just going to come in here and

52
00:01:36,320 --> 00:01:38,079
set my line thickness to 3

53
00:01:38,079 --> 00:01:40,240
instead of 1. so if i set my line

54
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,159
thickness to three

55
00:01:42,159 --> 00:01:45,360
and then we were to rerun this render

56
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
so i'm just going to tap f12 you can see

57
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,759
how these edges are going to be thicker

58
00:01:49,759 --> 00:01:51,520
so you can control the thickness of

59
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,680
those edges from this section

60
00:01:53,680 --> 00:01:56,000
right here but let's say we wanted to

61
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,840
get a little more in depth on what's

62
00:01:57,840 --> 00:01:59,040
actually being created

63
00:01:59,040 --> 00:02:00,719
right so that's great but it doesn't

64
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:02,320
really give us any control

65
00:02:02,320 --> 00:02:03,920
over anything other than there's some

66
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,719
edges in here so what we want to do

67
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:09,840
is we want to jump over into our view

68
00:02:09,840 --> 00:02:11,120
layer properties

69
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,680
and we want to scroll down to our

70
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:14,720
freestyle

71
00:02:14,720 --> 00:02:17,280
line sets and so what our freestyle line

72
00:02:17,280 --> 00:02:18,480
sets is going to do is that's going to

73
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:20,239
let us control

74
00:02:20,239 --> 00:02:22,959
the kind of lines that are being created

75
00:02:22,959 --> 00:02:24,319
notice how you can add multiple

76
00:02:24,319 --> 00:02:25,920
different line sets in here

77
00:02:25,920 --> 00:02:28,000
if you were to run this render without a

78
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,239
line set in here so if i was to delete

79
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:30,800
this

80
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:32,879
even though we have freestyle enabled if

81
00:02:32,879 --> 00:02:34,319
we were to run this

82
00:02:34,319 --> 00:02:36,160
you can see how no edges are going to

83
00:02:36,160 --> 00:02:38,560
show up so you need to have a line set

84
00:02:38,560 --> 00:02:40,319
in here because that's what this is

85
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,840
going to reference in order to create

86
00:02:41,840 --> 00:02:42,959
those edges

87
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:44,160
and so there's a lot of different

88
00:02:44,160 --> 00:02:46,080
options in here for

89
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:47,360
different things that you can do with

90
00:02:47,360 --> 00:02:49,200
this and so there's some different

91
00:02:49,200 --> 00:02:50,000
options in here

92
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:51,760
for things that you can do in order to

93
00:02:51,760 --> 00:02:53,040
change the way

94
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:55,760
that your edges look inside of freestyle

95
00:02:55,760 --> 00:02:56,160
so

96
00:02:56,160 --> 00:02:58,480
um we'll look at these i'm not going to

97
00:02:58,480 --> 00:03:00,480
worry too much about these right here

98
00:03:00,480 --> 00:03:04,000
um so we may take a look take a look at

99
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,680
the render pass option a little bit

100
00:03:05,680 --> 00:03:06,319
later

101
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:07,440
but for right now we're just going to

102
00:03:07,440 --> 00:03:09,599
leave it as is so you can use this to

103
00:03:09,599 --> 00:03:10,959
render this as a separate

104
00:03:10,959 --> 00:03:13,920
pass instead of on the combined pass

105
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,920
which gives you some interesting options

106
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:18,080
but for now let's take a look first at

107
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,360
this option right here

108
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,599
so your edge detection option your

109
00:03:21,599 --> 00:03:22,879
crease angle

110
00:03:22,879 --> 00:03:25,440
that's going to control what edges are

111
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:26,799
being picked up

112
00:03:26,799 --> 00:03:28,319
that are actually getting those darkened

113
00:03:28,319 --> 00:03:30,159
edges so right now we have a crease

114
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,480
angle of 134 degrees well if we were to

115
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:33,519
bump this up

116
00:03:33,519 --> 00:03:36,480
to 180 degrees and then re-run this so

117
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:38,080
if we're to do an f12

118
00:03:38,080 --> 00:03:41,519
notice how you're going to get freestyle

119
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:42,000
edges

120
00:03:42,000 --> 00:03:44,400
basically on all of the different edges

121
00:03:44,400 --> 00:03:45,040
inside

122
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,599
of your model so now i'm seeing all of

123
00:03:47,599 --> 00:03:48,959
the geometry in here

124
00:03:48,959 --> 00:03:50,959
so you can control how heavy that is by

125
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,000
adjusting the

126
00:03:52,000 --> 00:03:54,239
degrees of your edge detection so if i

127
00:03:54,239 --> 00:03:56,000
were to drop that down to 90

128
00:03:56,000 --> 00:03:57,439
for example you're going to get a lot

129
00:03:57,439 --> 00:03:59,599
less edges in here you're really only

130
00:03:59,599 --> 00:04:01,599
getting the edges around the perimeter

131
00:04:01,599 --> 00:04:03,680
at that point so you can use that to

132
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:05,519
kind of adjust the overall

133
00:04:05,519 --> 00:04:07,360
in here to whatever you want i'm going

134
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:09,439
to put it back to 134 degrees for right

135
00:04:09,439 --> 00:04:10,000
now

136
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:12,000
so culling is helpful because it can

137
00:04:12,000 --> 00:04:13,280
hide the out of view

138
00:04:13,280 --> 00:04:14,799
edges so you're not doing that extra

139
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,720
processing work and so there's also some

140
00:04:16,720 --> 00:04:18,239
advanced options in here which i don't

141
00:04:18,239 --> 00:04:20,239
want to focus on too much for right now

142
00:04:20,239 --> 00:04:21,600
so we can mess around with that in the

143
00:04:21,600 --> 00:04:23,520
future if you're really interested in it

144
00:04:23,520 --> 00:04:24,560
but i don't think we're going to use

145
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:24,960
those

146
00:04:24,960 --> 00:04:27,759
too much so as of right now though

147
00:04:27,759 --> 00:04:28,800
what's happening

148
00:04:28,800 --> 00:04:32,080
is the system is kind of dictating

149
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,919
the way that our edges are showing up

150
00:04:33,919 --> 00:04:35,919
right so it's finding them for us

151
00:04:35,919 --> 00:04:37,919
using its algorithm and so there's

152
00:04:37,919 --> 00:04:39,440
different things in here

153
00:04:39,440 --> 00:04:42,160
that can adjust that and affect that and

154
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,199
so you can use

155
00:04:43,199 --> 00:04:45,199
these options down below to get a little

156
00:04:45,199 --> 00:04:47,199
bit more specific about what's being

157
00:04:47,199 --> 00:04:48,400
shown in here

158
00:04:48,400 --> 00:04:50,080
and so i'm going to stay kind of high

159
00:04:50,080 --> 00:04:52,320
level on this um just note that these

160
00:04:52,320 --> 00:04:53,280
different options

161
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:55,120
are going to are going to bring in

162
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,400
different edges

163
00:04:56,400 --> 00:04:58,080
when you render this so for example if

164
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,840
you were to select ridge and valley

165
00:04:59,840 --> 00:05:02,639
and then rerun this notice how you're

166
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:03,440
getting some

167
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:06,720
different edges in here than you were

168
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:07,520
before

169
00:05:07,520 --> 00:05:09,360
in some different areas but it's a

170
00:05:09,360 --> 00:05:10,720
little bit clunky so you're going to

171
00:05:10,720 --> 00:05:11,840
have to do a little bit of trial and

172
00:05:11,840 --> 00:05:13,680
error in here to figure out the

173
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,840
exact view that you really want or the

174
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:17,520
exact settings that really work

175
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,759
but what i do want to focus on right now

176
00:05:19,759 --> 00:05:21,759
is at the moment

177
00:05:21,759 --> 00:05:25,120
we're currently set to do this based on

178
00:05:25,120 --> 00:05:26,240
our crease edges

179
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:28,160
right so it's using the crease angle in

180
00:05:28,160 --> 00:05:30,880
here in order to generate those edges

181
00:05:30,880 --> 00:05:32,320
and so let's say for example that we

182
00:05:32,320 --> 00:05:34,320
were to uncheck this box for crease

183
00:05:34,320 --> 00:05:34,800
edges

184
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:37,039
and then rerun this well notice how now

185
00:05:37,039 --> 00:05:38,880
you're really only getting the border

186
00:05:38,880 --> 00:05:41,039
or the silhouette of the object and

187
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:42,639
that's being added based on the

188
00:05:42,639 --> 00:05:44,080
silhouette and border options

189
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:46,560
right here so if i was to uncheck those

190
00:05:46,560 --> 00:05:47,919
notice how we start getting some kind of

191
00:05:47,919 --> 00:05:49,280
weird results in here

192
00:05:49,280 --> 00:05:51,360
so we want to leave this to include the

193
00:05:51,360 --> 00:05:52,880
silhouette and the border

194
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:55,120
but let's say that we wanted some edges

195
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,280
that were running along the bonnie model

196
00:05:57,280 --> 00:06:00,960
to be highlighted right so let's say for

197
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:02,560
example and we're going to tab

198
00:06:02,560 --> 00:06:05,039
into edit mode real quick let's say that

199
00:06:05,039 --> 00:06:06,000
we wanted

200
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:09,440
these edges right here to show up

201
00:06:09,440 --> 00:06:11,440
in our freestyle well what we could do

202
00:06:11,440 --> 00:06:13,199
is we could select the edges that we

203
00:06:13,199 --> 00:06:13,840
want

204
00:06:13,840 --> 00:06:15,440
but then you can right click in edit

205
00:06:15,440 --> 00:06:17,440
mode and there's an option here for mark

206
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:20,000
freestyle edge so if you mark this as a

207
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:21,360
freestyle edge

208
00:06:21,360 --> 00:06:23,680
and you check the box for edge mark in

209
00:06:23,680 --> 00:06:25,520
here what that's going to do is that's

210
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:26,880
going to include that

211
00:06:26,880 --> 00:06:29,520
in your rendered image so notice how now

212
00:06:29,520 --> 00:06:31,039
this edge right here

213
00:06:31,039 --> 00:06:34,319
is being included inside of our image

214
00:06:34,319 --> 00:06:36,479
so you can use that to be more specific

215
00:06:36,479 --> 00:06:38,160
about what exactly you want the

216
00:06:38,160 --> 00:06:39,919
freestyle edges to show in here

217
00:06:39,919 --> 00:06:41,520
if you decide you don't want that to

218
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:43,600
show up then you could just come in here

219
00:06:43,600 --> 00:06:44,720
and select it

220
00:06:44,720 --> 00:06:46,240
and then right click and you can just

221
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,080
clear the freestyle edge

222
00:06:48,080 --> 00:06:49,840
if you clear the freestyle edge it's not

223
00:06:49,840 --> 00:06:51,199
going to show up in your rendering

224
00:06:51,199 --> 00:06:55,599
anymore so you can also down below

225
00:06:55,599 --> 00:06:58,880
set your freestyle line styles as well

226
00:06:58,880 --> 00:07:00,880
so up till now we've been basically

227
00:07:00,880 --> 00:07:02,000
setting what's going

228
00:07:02,000 --> 00:07:04,479
to show up as a part of that freestyle

229
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,560
but if you go down into your line style

230
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,400
you can also set the way

231
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:11,280
that this is going to show up so for

232
00:07:11,280 --> 00:07:12,000
example

233
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,759
you can set the kind of line strokes

234
00:07:13,759 --> 00:07:16,479
that are in here you can set the color

235
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:19,199
of your edges so for example let's say i

236
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:20,319
wanted these to render out

237
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,800
something other than black i could come

238
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,759
in here and set this to maybe like blue

239
00:07:25,759 --> 00:07:28,400
then if we were to do an f12 our edges

240
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:30,160
are going to render out as blue

241
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:31,599
and so you could set the color by

242
00:07:31,599 --> 00:07:32,880
clicking in here but if we were to go

243
00:07:32,880 --> 00:07:34,080
back into the strokes

244
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:35,919
setting there's an option down here for

245
00:07:35,919 --> 00:07:37,199
things like dashed line

246
00:07:37,199 --> 00:07:39,520
so if you wanted your lines to be dashed

247
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:40,560
you could set this

248
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,720
so that your first dash is has a length

249
00:07:42,720 --> 00:07:44,560
of 5 and then the gap has a length of

250
00:07:44,560 --> 00:07:45,199
five

251
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,039
so i just checked the box and then

252
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,039
entered some values in here well now if

253
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:50,400
i was to render this out

254
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:51,840
instead of having straight lines what

255
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:52,560
we're going to have is we're going to

256
00:07:52,560 --> 00:07:54,319
have dotted lines in here

257
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:55,680
so you could use this to create some

258
00:07:55,680 --> 00:07:57,199
kind of a blueprint view or a

259
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,400
highlighted view

260
00:07:58,400 --> 00:08:00,000
or something like that alright so your

261
00:08:00,000 --> 00:08:03,360
alpha is going to allow you to adjust

262
00:08:03,360 --> 00:08:06,560
how solid the lines are so for example

263
00:08:06,560 --> 00:08:09,360
right now if i render this right and we

264
00:08:09,360 --> 00:08:10,479
look at it right here i've got some

265
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:11,680
thicker edges

266
00:08:11,680 --> 00:08:12,720
and they're all kind of just like

267
00:08:12,720 --> 00:08:15,039
uniform black lines but

268
00:08:15,039 --> 00:08:16,639
if you were to come in here and adjust

269
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:19,199
your alpha transparency down

270
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:22,240
notice how your lines are much less

271
00:08:22,240 --> 00:08:23,039
defined

272
00:08:23,039 --> 00:08:24,639
right it's like you kind of drew them on

273
00:08:24,639 --> 00:08:26,319
here with a pencil or something like

274
00:08:26,319 --> 00:08:26,879
that

275
00:08:26,879 --> 00:08:30,160
so there's also options in here to do

276
00:08:30,160 --> 00:08:31,759
things like add modifiers

277
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,680
to that as well so you could add some

278
00:08:33,680 --> 00:08:35,279
noise

279
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,800
to your alpha so if you add noise what

280
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:39,919
that's going to do is that's going to

281
00:08:39,919 --> 00:08:40,959
randomly give you

282
00:08:40,959 --> 00:08:43,919
darker and lighter areas those are all

283
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,279
adjustable based on things like

284
00:08:45,279 --> 00:08:46,399
amplitude

285
00:08:46,399 --> 00:08:47,519
other things like that they're just

286
00:08:47,519 --> 00:08:49,600
going to give you different effects

287
00:08:49,600 --> 00:08:51,200
so you can use that to make this more

288
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:52,640
like a noisy

289
00:08:52,640 --> 00:08:55,839
like hand drawn stroke type thing so

290
00:08:55,839 --> 00:08:57,680
you can also adjust your thickness of

291
00:08:57,680 --> 00:08:59,600
your edges in the thickness tab

292
00:08:59,600 --> 00:09:01,519
so if i bring this down notice how my

293
00:09:01,519 --> 00:09:03,200
edges are going to be more narrow

294
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:05,200
if i bring this up my edges are going to

295
00:09:05,200 --> 00:09:07,200
be a lot thicker so you can use that to

296
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,080
adjust the thickness

297
00:09:08,080 --> 00:09:11,200
in here and you can also

298
00:09:11,200 --> 00:09:14,240
set this with a modifier so for example

299
00:09:14,240 --> 00:09:15,600
you could come in here and add a noise

300
00:09:15,600 --> 00:09:16,399
modifier

301
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,480
to your thickness and what that's going

302
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,320
to do is that's going to adjust your

303
00:09:20,320 --> 00:09:21,200
thickness

304
00:09:21,200 --> 00:09:23,519
randomly and so you can adjust like how

305
00:09:23,519 --> 00:09:24,320
strong that

306
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:29,200
that is by adjusting these settings

307
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:35,040
so you can adjust that thickness down

308
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:37,200
for example

309
00:09:37,200 --> 00:09:38,800
in order to just give like a little bit

310
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,320
of wobble to these lines

311
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,000
so you could couple that with maybe

312
00:09:42,000 --> 00:09:44,399
something like

313
00:09:44,399 --> 00:09:45,600
so you could couple that with something

314
00:09:45,600 --> 00:09:47,519
like your alpha transparency to create

315
00:09:47,519 --> 00:09:48,839
some really interesting

316
00:09:48,839 --> 00:09:51,519
results all right so one last thing i

317
00:09:51,519 --> 00:09:52,320
wanted to show you

318
00:09:52,320 --> 00:09:53,680
for right now we can talk about this

319
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:55,519
more in the future but

320
00:09:55,519 --> 00:09:56,880
um what i wanted to do is i wanted to

321
00:09:56,880 --> 00:09:58,640
show you how to create

322
00:09:58,640 --> 00:10:01,519
this image so this is just some cabinets

323
00:10:01,519 --> 00:10:03,519
i created in the piclone build of

324
00:10:03,519 --> 00:10:05,920
blender and i wanted to show you how to

325
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:07,200
render out just the

326
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:10,399
edges from this image so right now right

327
00:10:10,399 --> 00:10:11,920
we have this just set up a standard

328
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:13,440
freestyle so it's going to create our

329
00:10:13,440 --> 00:10:14,320
rendered view

330
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,240
then it's going to add the edges over

331
00:10:16,240 --> 00:10:17,839
here what we want to do is we want to

332
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,600
use the compositor to create an

333
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:23,279
image that only includes the edges and a

334
00:10:23,279 --> 00:10:23,760
color

335
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,760
background and so the first thing i want

336
00:10:25,760 --> 00:10:27,279
to do is i'm going to go back

337
00:10:27,279 --> 00:10:30,240
into my view layer properties under

338
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:31,120
freestyle

339
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,360
and i want to check the box for as

340
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:34,720
render pass

341
00:10:34,720 --> 00:10:36,320
and so what we're going to do when uh

342
00:10:36,320 --> 00:10:38,399
this is rendered as a render pass

343
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:40,800
what that means is that means that now

344
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:42,480
instead of this using this as a

345
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:43,760
composite

346
00:10:43,760 --> 00:10:45,360
like this if we were to go into our view

347
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,519
layer and look at our freestyle

348
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,120
you can see how those edges are being

349
00:10:49,120 --> 00:10:51,680
created as a completely separate pass

350
00:10:51,680 --> 00:10:55,040
in your rendering engine so now

351
00:10:55,040 --> 00:10:56,800
what i want to do is i want to jump over

352
00:10:56,800 --> 00:10:58,839
into the compositing

353
00:10:58,839 --> 00:11:01,839
tab

354
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:04,000
and what i've done is i've just created

355
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:05,519
a view

356
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:08,480
with my image editor up above and then

357
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:09,760
my compositor

358
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,839
down below we'll go ahead and drag this

359
00:11:11,839 --> 00:11:13,600
up a little bit so we can zoom in

360
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:15,680
a little bit more and so right now what

361
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,839
this has is this has our render layers

362
00:11:17,839 --> 00:11:20,640
and it has our composite and so what we

363
00:11:20,640 --> 00:11:21,519
want to do

364
00:11:21,519 --> 00:11:23,680
is we want to go in here and so what

365
00:11:23,680 --> 00:11:26,079
this has is this has a check box for as

366
00:11:26,079 --> 00:11:27,120
render pass

367
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:28,959
well notice how when i check the box for

368
00:11:28,959 --> 00:11:30,320
as render pass

369
00:11:30,320 --> 00:11:32,079
right here what that's doing is that's

370
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,640
adding a node to my render layers

371
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,120
that i can drag into my composite so

372
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:38,640
instead having my freestyle

373
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:40,640
in here right now or instead of having

374
00:11:40,640 --> 00:11:42,320
my image dragged in here right now i'm

375
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:43,440
just going to drag

376
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:46,240
the line for my freestyle over here so

377
00:11:46,240 --> 00:11:47,920
you can see how what that's doing

378
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:50,160
is that's creating this image right here

379
00:11:50,160 --> 00:11:52,000
that only has my freestyle

380
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:54,639
edges but we also need a color

381
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,440
background

382
00:11:55,440 --> 00:11:57,200
so what we want to do is we just want to

383
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:59,279
do a shift a and we want to add

384
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,680
a mix node so i'm just going to type in

385
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:02,959
search i'm going to type in

386
00:12:02,959 --> 00:12:05,440
mix we're going to click right here and

387
00:12:05,440 --> 00:12:06,639
what we want

388
00:12:06,639 --> 00:12:09,279
is we want this freestyle running into

389
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,000
this mix node

390
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,760
and then the image running out to the

391
00:12:11,760 --> 00:12:13,680
composite but what we want to do is

392
00:12:13,680 --> 00:12:15,200
we're going to drag the freestyle

393
00:12:15,200 --> 00:12:17,760
into the bottom box and undrag it from

394
00:12:17,760 --> 00:12:19,279
the top box

395
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:21,040
and so what that's going to do is that's

396
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:22,399
going to give us a black screen

397
00:12:22,399 --> 00:12:24,079
right so we don't have anything in here

398
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,839
right now so what we want to do is we

399
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:27,360
want to click on the button right here

400
00:12:27,360 --> 00:12:30,000
for alpha in order to include the alpha

401
00:12:30,000 --> 00:12:30,720
of the second

402
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:33,279
input what that means is that means that

403
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:34,480
we're basically going to use the

404
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:36,399
transparent background for the second

405
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:38,160
input so when you click on this

406
00:12:38,160 --> 00:12:40,320
notice how now what you're getting is

407
00:12:40,320 --> 00:12:41,360
you're getting an

408
00:12:41,360 --> 00:12:43,839
image in here with a white background

409
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,360
and your edges

410
00:12:45,360 --> 00:12:47,680
over top of it and so one thing to note

411
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,279
about this is if we were to go back for

412
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:49,839
example

413
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:52,399
and adjust our line thickness so if we

414
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,000
were to scroll into our freestyle line

415
00:12:54,000 --> 00:12:54,800
style

416
00:12:54,800 --> 00:12:58,000
and adjust this so our thickness

417
00:12:58,000 --> 00:13:00,079
is bigger so maybe to a value of like

418
00:13:00,079 --> 00:13:01,279
six and then

419
00:13:01,279 --> 00:13:03,920
if we were to type the f12 key what

420
00:13:03,920 --> 00:13:04,959
that's going to do is that's going to

421
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:06,639
re-render this

422
00:13:06,639 --> 00:13:08,240
and notice how then this update's in

423
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:09,760
here i've not figured out how to get the

424
00:13:09,760 --> 00:13:10,959
image editor to

425
00:13:10,959 --> 00:13:13,440
update automatically so if anyone knows

426
00:13:13,440 --> 00:13:14,320
let me know

427
00:13:14,320 --> 00:13:16,000
but now what this is going to allow us

428
00:13:16,000 --> 00:13:17,600
to do is that's going to allow us

429
00:13:17,600 --> 00:13:20,720
from our 3d model so if i was to drag

430
00:13:20,720 --> 00:13:21,040
this

431
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:24,399
over and have a 3d viewport node

432
00:13:24,399 --> 00:13:27,519
right here you can see our 3d image

433
00:13:27,519 --> 00:13:29,519
is over here but we're generating this

434
00:13:29,519 --> 00:13:30,720
2d

435
00:13:30,720 --> 00:13:34,079
line style image inside a blender so

436
00:13:34,079 --> 00:13:36,160
then if we were to type f12

437
00:13:36,160 --> 00:13:38,480
and then export this notice how this is

438
00:13:38,480 --> 00:13:40,079
exporting this is a render result that

439
00:13:40,079 --> 00:13:41,199
we can then save

440
00:13:41,199 --> 00:13:43,600
as an image so that's from in this video

441
00:13:43,600 --> 00:13:44,639
