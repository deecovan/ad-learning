1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,100
raucous and welcome back to another

2
00:00:02,100 --> 00:00:04,859
Thursday it's at least so 26 of the 10

3
00:00:04,859 --> 00:00:06,299
minute modelling challenge and I'm gonna

4
00:00:06,299 --> 00:00:08,220
do more low poly stuff today I'm gonna

5
00:00:08,220 --> 00:00:10,500
make a little red Swedish cottage there

6
00:00:10,500 --> 00:00:11,670
are some regions around here especially

7
00:00:11,670 --> 00:00:13,469
outside in the countryside you'll have

8
00:00:13,469 --> 00:00:15,269
loads of little red cottages everywhere

9
00:00:15,269 --> 00:00:16,770
and I think there's a bunt painted

10
00:00:16,770 --> 00:00:19,199
anything else but red so I'm gonna make

11
00:00:19,199 --> 00:00:21,270
it red just to make sure it fits in hope

12
00:00:21,270 --> 00:00:22,680
you've had a good week so far and I hope

13
00:00:22,680 --> 00:00:24,180
you've been doing a lot of modeling I

14
00:00:24,180 --> 00:00:25,590
know the Sun is coming out it's a bit of

15
00:00:25,590 --> 00:00:27,390
a noise because it gives glares and

16
00:00:27,390 --> 00:00:29,279
stuff built myself like a bunker here

17
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,960
I've got one window and that one I'm

18
00:00:30,960 --> 00:00:32,399
covered up so I couldn't make it look

19
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:34,469
like night at any time it's quite nice

20
00:00:34,469 --> 00:00:37,290
no reflections no bad conscious that you

21
00:00:37,290 --> 00:00:38,969
should be outside in the sunshine let's

22
00:00:38,969 --> 00:00:39,750
put the phone over here

23
00:00:39,750 --> 00:00:43,680
let's get cranking let's go cottaging go

24
00:00:43,680 --> 00:00:45,360
when we're off carbon turret mode a

25
00:00:45,360 --> 00:00:48,120
select everything's step it up with

26
00:00:48,120 --> 00:00:50,579
control scale and shift said we only

27
00:00:50,579 --> 00:00:51,750
want to go to scale it like that

28
00:00:51,750 --> 00:00:54,899
proportional off here geez at and then

29
00:00:54,899 --> 00:00:57,210
select these two vertices or edges right

30
00:00:57,210 --> 00:00:58,739
click and subdivide I'm gonna make a

31
00:00:58,739 --> 00:01:01,559
roof here so bring that up select these

32
00:01:01,559 --> 00:01:03,989
two shifty to duplicate it s the scale

33
00:01:03,989 --> 00:01:07,920
it's bring it down to maybe they're all

34
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:11,189
the extra long face normals and like

35
00:01:11,189 --> 00:01:13,170
this and then we'll do right click

36
00:01:13,170 --> 00:01:15,180
subdivide again this time maybe eight

37
00:01:15,180 --> 00:01:20,310
cuts to create tiles I to inset twice to

38
00:01:20,310 --> 00:01:21,960
make these tiles and then all T to

39
00:01:21,960 --> 00:01:24,150
extrude them along their normals and

40
00:01:24,150 --> 00:01:27,960
then now I'm gonna do mesh OOP mesh and

41
00:01:27,960 --> 00:01:29,850
then transform and randomize these if

42
00:01:29,850 --> 00:01:33,030
it's but that's too much 0.03 now let's

43
00:01:33,030 --> 00:01:35,850
colorize them so G on the left there see

44
00:01:35,850 --> 00:01:38,250
two circles select a few lease and we

45
00:01:38,250 --> 00:01:39,930
make them a bit darker proceed to

46
00:01:39,930 --> 00:01:41,759
deselect a few with the middle mouse put

47
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:44,579
them here Mike and darker and see again

48
00:01:44,579 --> 00:01:47,880
gonna make some really dark eyes okay

49
00:01:47,880 --> 00:01:50,159
now let's select this one again actually

50
00:01:50,159 --> 00:01:52,229
we have select all of them get that into

51
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:54,210
a different brown now I can select these

52
00:01:54,210 --> 00:01:55,770
you've got to make some planks that

53
00:01:55,770 --> 00:01:57,840
cover the edges of the tiles here so all

54
00:01:57,840 --> 00:02:00,020
to e to extrude long face normals and

55
00:02:00,020 --> 00:02:03,299
then we'll do ctrl + once and I have to

56
00:02:03,299 --> 00:02:05,759
manually deselect this cut loop select

57
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:06,990
here because I've broken their geometry

58
00:02:06,990 --> 00:02:10,110
a little to sort all t extra long face

59
00:02:10,110 --> 00:02:12,390
that's it and then now I have to say

60
00:02:12,390 --> 00:02:15,240
he's again because I want to call it

61
00:02:15,240 --> 00:02:18,270
these bikes I think ctrl+ and then white

62
00:02:18,270 --> 00:02:21,870
ok let's move to the base make that a

63
00:02:21,870 --> 00:02:24,000
red cottage and then I have to link

64
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:26,490
these vertices together with J because

65
00:02:26,490 --> 00:02:29,580
otherwise I can't loop cuts after J and

66
00:02:29,580 --> 00:02:33,060
then ctrl R let's do some white corners

67
00:02:33,060 --> 00:02:34,890
here house ok that want to have to cut

68
00:02:34,890 --> 00:02:36,480
them manually that way because I've

69
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:40,320
broken the geometry there as well so ok

70
00:02:40,320 --> 00:02:42,090
for the knife cut here once

71
00:02:42,090 --> 00:02:43,860
so these corners are going to be white

72
00:02:43,860 --> 00:02:45,780
in Sweden that's common it's called the

73
00:02:45,780 --> 00:02:48,239
tax new tile in Swedish white knots for

74
00:02:48,239 --> 00:02:50,640
some reason no maybe someone knows why

75
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:54,180
it's called I have no idea but white

76
00:02:54,180 --> 00:02:56,640
corners anyway all t extra-long face

77
00:02:56,640 --> 00:02:59,190
normals control pause and make them

78
00:02:59,190 --> 00:03:02,100
white that's it and here we can make a

79
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:04,739
door so let's select that face shift D

80
00:03:04,739 --> 00:03:08,220
scale scale X and bring it down to there

81
00:03:08,220 --> 00:03:10,470
eat extra Don I

82
00:03:10,470 --> 00:03:14,870
I have to do both Lisa try to insert

83
00:03:14,870 --> 00:03:18,989
that let's bring this out note e to

84
00:03:18,989 --> 00:03:20,250
extrude out

85
00:03:20,250 --> 00:03:23,580
lt's like linked make it white as well

86
00:03:23,580 --> 00:03:27,510
like the corners but a brown door shifty

87
00:03:27,510 --> 00:03:33,120
to make a door handle here notes X eats

88
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:36,019
extrude that one it's a big door handle

89
00:03:36,019 --> 00:03:39,870
G black ok and the whole door needs to

90
00:03:39,870 --> 00:03:42,450
go in wait too far out okay here let's

91
00:03:42,450 --> 00:03:45,090
make two windows that one first shift D

92
00:03:45,090 --> 00:03:46,890
doesn't matter if they're not the same

93
00:03:46,890 --> 00:03:49,170
size it's perfectly fine to be honest

94
00:03:49,170 --> 00:03:50,250
it's actually better if they're not

95
00:03:50,250 --> 00:03:51,390
because it looks a bit wonky

96
00:03:51,390 --> 00:03:53,730
can I try to stylize this house a lot so

97
00:03:53,730 --> 00:03:58,010
ll make those whites select these faces

98
00:03:58,010 --> 00:03:59,940
this one has to come out a little bit

99
00:03:59,940 --> 00:04:01,110
more I think we've got something to work

100
00:04:01,110 --> 00:04:04,799
with I to inset all T to extrude one

101
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,650
face normals and then make us

102
00:04:06,650 --> 00:04:11,989
blue okay 6:36 let's make some planks

103
00:04:11,989 --> 00:04:15,349
here so ctrl R to loot cut actually

104
00:04:15,349 --> 00:04:20,870
let's select select a few these planks

105
00:04:20,870 --> 00:04:25,880
every other and do all T to extrude

106
00:04:25,880 --> 00:04:29,000
longface now almost again and we can

107
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,970
just do mesh transform randomize those

108
00:04:31,970 --> 00:04:37,100
with it as well now we're going to

109
00:04:37,100 --> 00:04:38,510
stylize this even more so over

110
00:04:38,510 --> 00:04:41,660
proportional and G to move it I'm gonna

111
00:04:41,660 --> 00:04:45,050
make these corners swing in and out a

112
00:04:45,050 --> 00:04:46,789
lot here I think that looks a bit

113
00:04:46,789 --> 00:04:50,889
cartoony so let's just do that

114
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:54,289
I've seen better days this cottage when

115
00:04:54,289 --> 00:04:56,240
I build stuff I try it out I go over

116
00:04:56,240 --> 00:04:58,370
done on there all the details with a

117
00:04:58,370 --> 00:05:00,560
millimeters this one was built a lot

118
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:05,240
faster than okay G let's actually get

119
00:05:05,240 --> 00:05:07,220
the tiles monkey as well it's falling

120
00:05:07,220 --> 00:05:08,780
apart it's got some damp issues here I

121
00:05:08,780 --> 00:05:11,150
think sometime I think we have to have

122
00:05:11,150 --> 00:05:18,789
some surveyor looking at this g-gee okay

123
00:05:20,200 --> 00:05:23,690
let's stylize this door as well the one

124
00:05:23,690 --> 00:05:26,990
care the better okay 515 or something

125
00:05:26,990 --> 00:05:30,950
517 now we can make some colorization

126
00:05:30,950 --> 00:05:33,710
here as well we've got time I think K

127
00:05:33,710 --> 00:05:38,020
for the knife to add some

128
00:05:40,479 --> 00:05:42,400
okay you probably don't want to do this

129
00:05:42,400 --> 00:05:44,860
if you want or actually you could do

130
00:05:44,860 --> 00:05:46,360
this but you should make a separate

131
00:05:46,360 --> 00:05:49,319
level detail version elodie version with

132
00:05:49,319 --> 00:05:52,270
with less purchases and stuff if you

133
00:05:52,270 --> 00:05:53,770
want to use it as a shadow caster maybe

134
00:05:53,770 --> 00:05:56,110
and save some performance or if you

135
00:05:56,110 --> 00:05:57,699
wanna use it as a Collider you should

136
00:05:57,699 --> 00:05:59,830
probably not have all these vertices and

137
00:05:59,830 --> 00:06:01,270
if you want subdivide it but why would

138
00:06:01,270 --> 00:06:03,309
you want to subdivide it a cottage

139
00:06:03,309 --> 00:06:10,689
I wouldn't okay so now we've got those

140
00:06:10,689 --> 00:06:13,870
we can actually three face select and

141
00:06:13,870 --> 00:06:15,400
select a few this I'm gonna make these

142
00:06:15,400 --> 00:06:18,159
darker red so just shift select all of

143
00:06:18,159 --> 00:06:25,599
these and 423 okay there and now we go G

144
00:06:25,599 --> 00:06:29,740
and then alt eat extra long face normals

145
00:06:29,740 --> 00:06:33,460
again and that's it now we can make this

146
00:06:33,460 --> 00:06:37,899
basic scale that on e to extrude it I've

147
00:06:37,899 --> 00:06:41,319
got an extra geometry here no L let's

148
00:06:41,319 --> 00:06:43,240
make it like a rock base for this house

149
00:06:43,240 --> 00:06:48,039
control or tool it cut it once and twice

150
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:56,860
and three times four times and L to

151
00:06:56,860 --> 00:06:58,599
select everything we can scale it down a

152
00:06:58,599 --> 00:07:01,020
bit again a scale on the x-axis

153
00:07:01,020 --> 00:07:04,240
and now I'll just move these off

154
00:07:04,240 --> 00:07:06,969
actually like as if it's some sort of a

155
00:07:06,969 --> 00:07:09,879
corner stone here we can maybe bring

156
00:07:09,879 --> 00:07:14,020
let's do all T on these as well stick

157
00:07:14,020 --> 00:07:16,149
out a little bit as well shift select a

158
00:07:16,149 --> 00:07:17,669
bunch of these

159
00:07:17,669 --> 00:07:21,419
Balti extra long edges we can reduce

160
00:07:21,419 --> 00:07:24,659
this whole slice of ability okay and a

161
00:07:24,659 --> 00:07:26,219
bit of wonkiness to this as well we

162
00:07:26,219 --> 00:07:27,900
don't want it to be too perfect

163
00:07:27,900 --> 00:07:29,810
we should really have a chimney as well

164
00:07:29,810 --> 00:07:38,370
so oh three minutes let's make a chimney

165
00:07:38,370 --> 00:07:40,560
so let's pick one of the tiles here

166
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,990
maybe that one the sort of bugs shift D

167
00:07:42,990 --> 00:07:47,990
altered if he's like proportional G

168
00:07:47,990 --> 00:07:50,969
should make a great chimney all t to

169
00:07:50,969 --> 00:07:53,699
extrude long face normals eats extrude s

170
00:07:53,699 --> 00:07:57,620
to scale each extreme o

171
00:07:57,620 --> 00:08:00,900
doing spit then probably sorry about

172
00:08:00,900 --> 00:08:02,789
that

173
00:08:02,789 --> 00:08:05,250
I can't even fix it in post because I'm

174
00:08:05,250 --> 00:08:07,770
not editing this section where I model

175
00:08:07,770 --> 00:08:10,020
stuff edit any of this out so I have to

176
00:08:10,020 --> 00:08:12,139
keep everything in that just happened

177
00:08:12,139 --> 00:08:14,520
that's it there's a chimney wonky as

178
00:08:14,520 --> 00:08:15,210
well

179
00:08:15,210 --> 00:08:17,400
two minutes let's make a little days for

180
00:08:17,400 --> 00:08:19,110
this to stand on maybe shift D to

181
00:08:19,110 --> 00:08:21,240
duplicate it s to scale that one out

182
00:08:21,240 --> 00:08:25,039
maybe like this G to move it to gray

183
00:08:25,039 --> 00:08:27,779
well why did I make it greener because I

184
00:08:27,779 --> 00:08:28,740
wanted it clean

185
00:08:28,740 --> 00:08:31,710
Oh proportional off a texture that one

186
00:08:31,710 --> 00:08:35,089
down ctrl or maybe eight Lucas and

187
00:08:35,089 --> 00:08:39,089
control Oregon eight lip cuts and let's

188
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:40,490
bring this down a bit

189
00:08:40,490 --> 00:08:42,479
selectively here the corner ones here

190
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:49,010
and how am i doing 1:58 G Oh

191
00:08:49,010 --> 00:08:51,779
proportionally and although the only

192
00:08:51,779 --> 00:08:53,730
work link I don't the house dissing G

193
00:08:53,730 --> 00:08:56,240
said

194
00:08:57,509 --> 00:09:00,509
okay

195
00:09:00,870 --> 00:09:07,559
geez that got some issues here with that

196
00:09:07,559 --> 00:09:09,220
no that's okay

197
00:09:09,220 --> 00:09:11,769
am I getting tricked let's do this

198
00:09:11,769 --> 00:09:14,339
manually then

199
00:09:18,620 --> 00:09:24,630
lower few the corners here it's gonna be

200
00:09:24,630 --> 00:09:25,710
a little bit like a floating island

201
00:09:25,710 --> 00:09:36,230
isn't it all set 113 is a waste of time

202
00:09:36,230 --> 00:09:40,380
also that's it

203
00:09:40,380 --> 00:09:42,300
we can do the base a little bit control

204
00:09:42,300 --> 00:09:45,450
seven to see at the bottom and we've got

205
00:09:45,450 --> 00:09:47,760
some geometry poking through everything

206
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:54,210
to me yep to rescue you and rescue you

207
00:09:54,210 --> 00:09:58,380
that's it control seven how many links

208
00:09:58,380 --> 00:10:01,560
four to six seconds see two circle

209
00:10:01,560 --> 00:10:04,380
select a few of these just make you

210
00:10:04,380 --> 00:10:10,529
brown eg to move it down e to extrude on

211
00:10:10,529 --> 00:10:13,110
s to scale it of ctrl + it's making

212
00:10:13,110 --> 00:10:18,779
everything brown here how am i doing 26

213
00:10:18,779 --> 00:10:21,320
seconds

214
00:10:23,460 --> 00:10:29,250
gee tune in the hunt that's a

215
00:10:34,360 --> 00:10:40,399
I'll move the handling that's it four

216
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:41,320
seconds to go

217
00:10:41,320 --> 00:10:43,670
that's it that's our little house on the

218
00:10:43,670 --> 00:10:49,310
island again okey-dokey

219
00:10:49,310 --> 00:10:50,870
[Music]

220
00:10:50,870 --> 00:10:52,950
all right folks so we've got a little

221
00:10:52,950 --> 00:10:55,140
traditional Swedish cottage here with a

222
00:10:55,140 --> 00:10:57,900
little chimney and a wonky door it's

223
00:10:57,900 --> 00:10:59,550
gonna be I wanted to have a really

224
00:10:59,550 --> 00:11:01,710
cartoony wonky look to it hopefully that

225
00:11:01,710 --> 00:11:03,330
came through yeah it looks pretty all

226
00:11:03,330 --> 00:11:05,400
right I think and it's standing on a

227
00:11:05,400 --> 00:11:09,900
little green pasture so should we

228
00:11:09,900 --> 00:11:14,000
disable maybe specular

229
00:11:14,120 --> 00:11:16,200
alright folks so there we have it we've

230
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,210
got a little Swedish cottage here seen

231
00:11:18,210 --> 00:11:20,310
better days I think we need to have like

232
00:11:20,310 --> 00:11:22,200
I said some some sort of an inspector

233
00:11:22,200 --> 00:11:23,940
looking at this because there we've got

234
00:11:23,940 --> 00:11:26,250
some issues with the roof here we've got

235
00:11:26,250 --> 00:11:28,020
some dump issues going we've got some

236
00:11:28,020 --> 00:11:30,600
wonky corners I'm dread to look what

237
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,100
it's inside it's probably bare enough to

238
00:11:32,100 --> 00:11:34,110
just to be a dust which is the Swedish

239
00:11:34,110 --> 00:11:37,680
word for an outhouse where it stinks

240
00:11:37,680 --> 00:11:42,180
pretty much for this video let's see did

241
00:11:42,180 --> 00:11:43,860
I do anything different so I've done

242
00:11:43,860 --> 00:11:46,680
pretty much all the stuff I did one tip

243
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:48,930
is if you wanted to randomize some stuff

244
00:11:48,930 --> 00:11:50,850
that you've got selected so when you

245
00:11:50,850 --> 00:11:52,590
have a bunch of randomized or when you

246
00:11:52,590 --> 00:11:57,260
have a bunch of faces selected like this

247
00:11:57,260 --> 00:11:59,430
this one is called I think I used it in

248
00:11:59,430 --> 00:12:01,710
the last one mesh transform randomize

249
00:12:01,710 --> 00:12:04,050
that just offsets everything a little

250
00:12:04,050 --> 00:12:06,660
bit and you can change how much and you

251
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,190
can also change some other parameters

252
00:12:08,190 --> 00:12:10,860
there I've just recently started to use

253
00:12:10,860 --> 00:12:12,960
that one and sometimes you have to be

254
00:12:12,960 --> 00:12:14,730
careful because when you warp it too

255
00:12:14,730 --> 00:12:16,320
much it'll intersect itself and you

256
00:12:16,320 --> 00:12:18,360
don't ever want to have like a vertex

257
00:12:18,360 --> 00:12:19,620
here for example you don't want that to

258
00:12:19,620 --> 00:12:22,650
be proportional on G you don't want that

259
00:12:22,650 --> 00:12:25,770
to be poking through the geometry like

260
00:12:25,770 --> 00:12:28,110
that that's bad and if you go too hard

261
00:12:28,110 --> 00:12:30,420
on this randomize that can happen it

262
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:31,950
doesn't have any protection against that

263
00:12:31,950 --> 00:12:33,600
as far as I know it also works if you

264
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:35,160
have vertices selected for example you

265
00:12:35,160 --> 00:12:36,900
can go to mesh again transform and

266
00:12:36,900 --> 00:12:39,960
randomize those as well so edges faces

267
00:12:39,960 --> 00:12:42,390
and vertices you can randomize like that

268
00:12:42,390 --> 00:12:43,589
that was a lot of proportional editing

269
00:12:43,589 --> 00:12:46,920
again and some K for the knife cuts to

270
00:12:46,920 --> 00:12:48,990
create these little features to get the

271
00:12:48,990 --> 00:12:51,210
colorization there and just a lot of

272
00:12:51,210 --> 00:12:53,130
proportional editing here too too wonky

273
00:12:53,130 --> 00:12:55,650
Phi it that's a new term one key fight

274
00:12:55,650 --> 00:12:58,290
so instead of doing a lot of tips like

275
00:12:58,290 --> 00:12:59,850
that let's just keep modeling a little

276
00:12:59,850 --> 00:13:00,300
bit shall we

277
00:13:00,300 --> 00:13:00,870
Oh

278
00:13:00,870 --> 00:13:02,700
and a few minutes of modeling so if we

279
00:13:02,700 --> 00:13:04,050
were to continue with this one what we

280
00:13:04,050 --> 00:13:05,580
want to do maybe wanted to add some

281
00:13:05,580 --> 00:13:08,640
plumbing so we could do here for example

282
00:13:08,640 --> 00:13:10,710
on the side which side should we pick

283
00:13:10,710 --> 00:13:14,279
that's this right side here so obviously

284
00:13:14,279 --> 00:13:15,720
this is not part of my 10-minute

285
00:13:15,720 --> 00:13:17,430
modelling challenge now this is the

286
00:13:17,430 --> 00:13:18,839
result that I'll be using as a thumbnail

287
00:13:18,839 --> 00:13:20,880
and this is what I managed to do in ten

288
00:13:20,880 --> 00:13:21,240
minutes

289
00:13:21,240 --> 00:13:22,980
but let's just be a little bit casual

290
00:13:22,980 --> 00:13:24,720
now maybe today let's have a casual

291
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:27,450
Thursday episode 26 so if I grab this

292
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:30,839
one and move this down let's move a few

293
00:13:30,839 --> 00:13:33,180
of this time as well what should we do

294
00:13:33,180 --> 00:13:35,100
here for some reason I want to have some

295
00:13:35,100 --> 00:13:37,710
sort of sewage coming out here so let's

296
00:13:37,710 --> 00:13:40,710
move this out so imagine that the house

297
00:13:40,710 --> 00:13:43,740
have got some plumbing in it that we

298
00:13:43,740 --> 00:13:46,650
wanted to see here so if I just move a

299
00:13:46,650 --> 00:13:48,210
few of these I've still got proportional

300
00:13:48,210 --> 00:13:50,970
editing also I have to be careful with

301
00:13:50,970 --> 00:13:54,720
the proportional if you do alt oh then

302
00:13:54,720 --> 00:13:57,120
it toggles here between connected and

303
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,310
not because you have to be careful here

304
00:13:59,310 --> 00:14:02,880
if you've got not connected only there

305
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:05,580
and you put G to move that one be aware

306
00:14:05,580 --> 00:14:06,959
that you drag the whole house down with

307
00:14:06,959 --> 00:14:08,370
you maybe that's what you want to do

308
00:14:08,370 --> 00:14:09,810
sometimes to make it follow the ground

309
00:14:09,810 --> 00:14:12,779
but if you only want to modify the this

310
00:14:12,779 --> 00:14:14,160
separate and this is actually part of

311
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:16,260
the same object here we this is still a

312
00:14:16,260 --> 00:14:17,670
default cube remember that we've

313
00:14:17,670 --> 00:14:20,220
modified a tiny bit so this green part

314
00:14:20,220 --> 00:14:21,630
here the grass it's actually part of

315
00:14:21,630 --> 00:14:24,180
this cube object but if I press L here

316
00:14:24,180 --> 00:14:26,040
you can see that it's all the vertices

317
00:14:26,040 --> 00:14:27,779
are connected to only each other not to

318
00:14:27,779 --> 00:14:30,870
the house so if I were to move if I take

319
00:14:30,870 --> 00:14:32,490
proportional off and move it this is

320
00:14:32,490 --> 00:14:35,010
actually just in the same object but a

321
00:14:35,010 --> 00:14:36,589
lot of geometry that's not connected

322
00:14:36,589 --> 00:14:39,930
that was just so much work to try to say

323
00:14:39,930 --> 00:14:41,130
and I still didn't manage to get the

324
00:14:41,130 --> 00:14:42,660
message across but I think you've got it

325
00:14:42,660 --> 00:14:44,100
by note because I've said it quite a few

326
00:14:44,100 --> 00:14:47,190
times so let's see here we let's bring

327
00:14:47,190 --> 00:14:49,290
this down a little bit further even more

328
00:14:49,290 --> 00:14:57,000
key Oh again for proportional this may

329
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:00,950
be there and here maybe we'd do this

330
00:15:00,950 --> 00:15:05,780
brown a little slumped here

331
00:15:05,780 --> 00:15:11,540
so not that once G move out to brown

332
00:15:11,540 --> 00:15:13,370
here you can see as well that this is

333
00:15:13,370 --> 00:15:16,520
one face now and it's got some struggles

334
00:15:16,520 --> 00:15:18,110
here to render it and so what we should

335
00:15:18,110 --> 00:15:20,270
do here is I should select that on and

336
00:15:20,270 --> 00:15:21,680
that one and press J to link these

337
00:15:21,680 --> 00:15:24,710
together that'll force it to cut the

338
00:15:24,710 --> 00:15:26,270
triangle the way we want it because I

339
00:15:26,270 --> 00:15:29,000
want to colorize these brown hairs so

340
00:15:29,000 --> 00:15:30,980
now we've got a little slope here maybe

341
00:15:30,980 --> 00:15:34,400
I'll do take proportional off shift D to

342
00:15:34,400 --> 00:15:36,500
duplicate it subdivide it right-click

343
00:15:36,500 --> 00:15:38,570
subdivide and then I'll only select

344
00:15:38,570 --> 00:15:40,250
these faces here what am i doing now

345
00:15:40,250 --> 00:15:41,450
actually I don't want to do that on a

346
00:15:41,450 --> 00:15:43,970
scale it down and then f3 and then I'll

347
00:15:43,970 --> 00:15:46,310
type in circle and that'll make it

348
00:15:46,310 --> 00:15:48,230
circle and for that to work you should

349
00:15:48,230 --> 00:15:49,670
have this if you go to edit here

350
00:15:49,670 --> 00:15:52,370
preferences you have an ad on here

351
00:15:52,370 --> 00:15:54,950
called loop tools and it comes with a

352
00:15:54,950 --> 00:15:57,170
unique unit it doesn't come with unity

353
00:15:57,170 --> 00:15:59,480
believe me it comes with blender by

354
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,370
default but you have to enable it and if

355
00:16:01,370 --> 00:16:03,740
you type in f3 and type in circle you

356
00:16:03,740 --> 00:16:05,630
can actually make it turn any geometry

357
00:16:05,630 --> 00:16:07,550
and try to make it into a circle and

358
00:16:07,550 --> 00:16:10,430
then we can rotate it on the y-axis to

359
00:16:10,430 --> 00:16:13,280
flip it up and then e to extrude it L to

360
00:16:13,280 --> 00:16:15,170
select everything here again s to scale

361
00:16:15,170 --> 00:16:17,390
of town and plumbing I guess we should

362
00:16:17,390 --> 00:16:19,339
make it like some sort of a teal pile

363
00:16:19,339 --> 00:16:22,850
teal eye clay color orange no actually I

364
00:16:22,850 --> 00:16:25,360
want to make it

365
00:16:25,410 --> 00:16:29,669
it could be disappointing concrete or

366
00:16:29,669 --> 00:16:31,439
metal metal plumbing select that one

367
00:16:31,439 --> 00:16:33,119
again let's make it a bit brighter no

368
00:16:33,119 --> 00:16:35,579
and now I select these faces each

369
00:16:35,579 --> 00:16:37,739
extruder on s to scale it's e to extrude

370
00:16:37,739 --> 00:16:40,859
it make your pipe entrance here and

371
00:16:40,859 --> 00:16:43,589
again sometimes for a stylized scene

372
00:16:43,589 --> 00:16:44,819
like this you probably don't want it to

373
00:16:44,819 --> 00:16:48,029
be this perfect all the time perfect as

374
00:16:48,029 --> 00:16:50,669
if it was perfect but yeah back with

375
00:16:50,669 --> 00:16:52,799
proportional auto to make sure it's

376
00:16:52,799 --> 00:16:56,759
connected only and then G to move on and

377
00:16:56,759 --> 00:16:58,439
let's just make this pipe a little bit

378
00:16:58,439 --> 00:17:00,359
wonky too because if you suddenly have

379
00:17:00,359 --> 00:17:03,089
perfect geometry I can't it's not

380
00:17:03,089 --> 00:17:05,759
perfect what am I going on about anyway

381
00:17:05,759 --> 00:17:11,579
you get the point so maybe like that and

382
00:17:11,579 --> 00:17:14,009
then Oh proportional off you move it

383
00:17:14,009 --> 00:17:16,679
into there ctrl + and just simulate that

384
00:17:16,679 --> 00:17:18,269
it's shaded in there so I'll move it's a

385
00:17:18,269 --> 00:17:20,369
dark corner and now let's make some

386
00:17:20,369 --> 00:17:22,859
water pouring out - if this is an

387
00:17:22,859 --> 00:17:26,638
outward I can't say that if this is an

388
00:17:26,638 --> 00:17:28,500
outdoor toilet then you probably

389
00:17:28,500 --> 00:17:32,759
wouldn't want windows on it and let's

390
00:17:32,759 --> 00:17:35,399
extrude that one I just did shift D to

391
00:17:35,399 --> 00:17:37,200
duplicate that one now in there and then

392
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:41,580
I make this blue pull that on now we're

393
00:17:41,580 --> 00:17:43,830
gonna make some water point out here we

394
00:17:43,830 --> 00:17:47,039
can do all zet to see through press the

395
00:17:47,039 --> 00:17:49,379
3 on the keypad no we press 1 on the

396
00:17:49,379 --> 00:17:51,120
keypad to see it from the side here now

397
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,370
we can do that other extrusion method

398
00:17:53,370 --> 00:17:55,049
let's just check actually which one I

399
00:17:55,049 --> 00:17:56,549
want to follow I'll follow this path

400
00:17:56,549 --> 00:17:59,490
here so I'll do one again here I think

401
00:17:59,490 --> 00:18:00,990
it's this one that's the slanting here

402
00:18:00,990 --> 00:18:03,720
so we'll just do some control right

403
00:18:03,720 --> 00:18:05,909
clicking here as if the water is pouring

404
00:18:05,909 --> 00:18:08,669
out here I'll try to follow roughly

405
00:18:08,669 --> 00:18:12,779
where I think it was here and then it

406
00:18:12,779 --> 00:18:14,730
just pours off here so I'm just right

407
00:18:14,730 --> 00:18:17,789
clicking and I should do it hold side

408
00:18:17,789 --> 00:18:19,710
again to see through okay we did it -

409
00:18:19,710 --> 00:18:22,470
too deep but that's ok we can fix it

410
00:18:22,470 --> 00:18:25,259
we can go press o for proportional again

411
00:18:25,259 --> 00:18:27,899
and then do G and then zev to move it up

412
00:18:27,899 --> 00:18:30,809
and then we can do the same here all set

413
00:18:30,809 --> 00:18:33,320
actually first let's select a few these

414
00:18:33,320 --> 00:18:37,050
but not this one ok let's redo that

415
00:18:37,050 --> 00:18:38,760
it's funny it picks exactly the face I

416
00:18:38,760 --> 00:18:45,030
don't wanna pick all set and scare we

417
00:18:45,030 --> 00:18:48,240
can scale this to old said it's kind of

418
00:18:48,240 --> 00:18:51,120
placed here Paul said proportional so we

419
00:18:51,120 --> 00:18:52,920
don't have to be picky at all this so

420
00:18:52,920 --> 00:18:55,290
that's the beautiful that's the beauty

421
00:18:55,290 --> 00:19:02,179
part but we'll select a few these okay

422
00:19:08,360 --> 00:19:09,750
down there

423
00:19:09,750 --> 00:19:16,440
scale y-axis rotate it's okay that

424
00:19:16,440 --> 00:19:17,790
didn't work that's okay

425
00:19:17,790 --> 00:19:21,059
rotate this one just go a little bit

426
00:19:21,059 --> 00:19:23,640
slower now so I can speak a little bit

427
00:19:23,640 --> 00:19:25,260
better about everything that I do rotate

428
00:19:25,260 --> 00:19:28,530
on the x-axis just rotate the roughly

429
00:19:28,530 --> 00:19:32,250
into place there will give me a few know

430
00:19:32,250 --> 00:19:36,030
a few of these faces up and we have to

431
00:19:36,030 --> 00:19:40,890
bring it down as welcome you can scale

432
00:19:40,890 --> 00:19:43,470
this whole thing a bit thicker so let's

433
00:19:43,470 --> 00:19:47,760
just select this proportional is on

434
00:19:47,760 --> 00:19:51,890
scale said okay then I can't select ease

435
00:19:51,890 --> 00:19:53,610
making it a lot more complicated

436
00:19:53,610 --> 00:19:55,590
information that I need to know every

437
00:19:55,590 --> 00:19:57,420
time I try to slow down and explain what

438
00:19:57,420 --> 00:19:59,550
I'm doing I'm doing a worse job at

439
00:19:59,550 --> 00:20:01,110
modeling and I'm doing a worse job in

440
00:20:01,110 --> 00:20:05,760
explaining don't know odd-eyes so small

441
00:20:05,760 --> 00:20:08,990
its scale said

442
00:20:09,040 --> 00:20:11,630
okay I'm scaling the hole in there

443
00:20:11,630 --> 00:20:14,810
that's by scale is that bringing these

444
00:20:14,810 --> 00:20:19,630
up with it awfully proportional again

445
00:20:20,440 --> 00:20:24,500
mm-hmm now that I'm seeing it I'm

446
00:20:24,500 --> 00:20:26,720
actually surprised so much water is

447
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,860
pouring out from this little cottage

448
00:20:27,860 --> 00:20:29,990
makes me a bit scared to know what's

449
00:20:29,990 --> 00:20:30,770
going on in there

450
00:20:30,770 --> 00:20:32,530
I think they've left this sink running

451
00:20:32,530 --> 00:20:35,210
where's the pipe coming there okay so

452
00:20:35,210 --> 00:20:36,740
that's one thing we could have done a

453
00:20:36,740 --> 00:20:38,480
little pipe there maybe we bring these

454
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:42,190
edges down to make or in together here

455
00:20:42,190 --> 00:20:48,080
make it like so should it be maybe a

456
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,170
little bridge that crosses over here

457
00:20:50,170 --> 00:20:52,160
should it be a bridge crossing over

458
00:20:52,160 --> 00:20:54,800
shift D duplicate that I often work like

459
00:20:54,800 --> 00:20:57,380
this I do shift I pick a face and then I

460
00:20:57,380 --> 00:20:59,090
do shift D to duplicate it because then

461
00:20:59,090 --> 00:21:00,830
it's detached then I can use this whole

462
00:21:00,830 --> 00:21:04,190
trickery with the L key to select linked

463
00:21:04,190 --> 00:21:06,970
and everything like that and I just

464
00:21:06,970 --> 00:21:09,380
reshape that one and then I do e to

465
00:21:09,380 --> 00:21:11,540
extrude it to make it thick and then

466
00:21:11,540 --> 00:21:15,890
Estes killer on and now this is the nice

467
00:21:15,890 --> 00:21:19,820
thing L to select it and then G on the

468
00:21:19,820 --> 00:21:21,740
left here to move that one and then

469
00:21:21,740 --> 00:21:27,440
we'll do just to shift D Y minus one

470
00:21:27,440 --> 00:21:31,190
minus zero point zero point seven and

471
00:21:31,190 --> 00:21:33,710
then shift are a few times make those

472
00:21:33,710 --> 00:21:35,900
planks across and now they all look the

473
00:21:35,900 --> 00:21:37,250
same so we can't really have it like

474
00:21:37,250 --> 00:21:40,250
that obviously so we can just pick one

475
00:21:40,250 --> 00:21:44,060
to do do vertical xo2 get proportional

476
00:21:44,060 --> 00:21:48,380
and then we can just what we could do

477
00:21:48,380 --> 00:21:51,390
actually let's try to do them

478
00:21:51,390 --> 00:21:53,770
let's press L on all of these planks now

479
00:21:53,770 --> 00:21:56,440
and then we did what their tip was shift

480
00:21:56,440 --> 00:21:57,880
l if you're a deselect the whole linked

481
00:21:57,880 --> 00:21:59,830
package like that mesh transform

482
00:21:59,830 --> 00:22:02,680
randomize and now we can actually slide

483
00:22:02,680 --> 00:22:05,470
it up a bit more make it more I don't

484
00:22:05,470 --> 00:22:06,700
have to be so worried the objects are

485
00:22:06,700 --> 00:22:07,900
quite big so I don't have to be too

486
00:22:07,900 --> 00:22:10,960
worried about that they are intersecting

487
00:22:10,960 --> 00:22:14,590
too badly so scale may be on y-axis got

488
00:22:14,590 --> 00:22:17,050
one no that's okay I thought that one

489
00:22:17,050 --> 00:22:18,160
what could have been in the danger zone

490
00:22:18,160 --> 00:22:20,530
a bit but it wasn't danger zone makes me

491
00:22:20,530 --> 00:22:23,640
think of Top Gun that was a good movie

492
00:22:23,640 --> 00:22:27,490
1984 the Swedish number of people that

493
00:22:27,490 --> 00:22:29,770
applied to become a fighter pilot after

494
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,140
that one aired in the cinema was I don't

495
00:22:32,140 --> 00:22:33,370
even know the number but it was a lot of

496
00:22:33,370 --> 00:22:34,750
people that applied and wanted to become

497
00:22:34,750 --> 00:22:37,420
fighter pilots however we got off the

498
00:22:37,420 --> 00:22:39,850
top gun I don't know oh yeah danger zone

499
00:22:39,850 --> 00:22:42,010
that's it so we've got like a lot of

500
00:22:42,010 --> 00:22:43,480
planks here maybe we should have some

501
00:22:43,480 --> 00:22:47,020
posts as well so I can just do another

502
00:22:47,020 --> 00:22:48,850
face we'll pick a random one that on the

503
00:22:48,850 --> 00:22:51,700
loop off with proportional scale it down

504
00:22:51,700 --> 00:22:55,060
keep to move it there get to move it

505
00:22:55,060 --> 00:22:58,120
down get to move it there make it brown

506
00:22:58,120 --> 00:23:03,130
eat extrude it l2 select the links and

507
00:23:03,130 --> 00:23:06,340
again this is the nice thing you just

508
00:23:06,340 --> 00:23:08,470
like back in the day which would have

509
00:23:08,470 --> 00:23:10,060
been like four weeks ago or something I

510
00:23:10,060 --> 00:23:13,270
would have not really made stuff so

511
00:23:13,270 --> 00:23:14,950
wonky but then what I was modeling the

512
00:23:14,950 --> 00:23:17,140
part island I realized that the wonky it

513
00:23:17,140 --> 00:23:19,420
is probably the better it looks when it

514
00:23:19,420 --> 00:23:21,700
comes to like a low poly look so don't

515
00:23:21,700 --> 00:23:22,840
be afraid don't try to make everything

516
00:23:22,840 --> 00:23:25,270
perfect and aligned and stuff like that

517
00:23:25,270 --> 00:23:27,220
if you've got any sort of OCD similar to

518
00:23:27,220 --> 00:23:28,870
what I've got which is like I mentioned

519
00:23:28,870 --> 00:23:30,640
it in a previous video as well it's like

520
00:23:30,640 --> 00:23:33,400
symmetry and pixel perfect alignment

521
00:23:33,400 --> 00:23:35,770
that's usually my motto so it feels

522
00:23:35,770 --> 00:23:36,850
quite liberating

523
00:23:36,850 --> 00:23:39,150
no I'm not gonna use that word it's been

524
00:23:39,150 --> 00:23:42,040
contaminated it's quite nice to be able

525
00:23:42,040 --> 00:23:45,490
to just to do stuff like this okay

526
00:23:45,490 --> 00:23:48,940
so that's a maybe we should do some sort

527
00:23:48,940 --> 00:23:51,039
of a rail here as well so we don't want

528
00:23:51,039 --> 00:23:53,289
to fall down into the sewage water which

529
00:23:53,289 --> 00:23:55,809
it might not even be sewage water you

530
00:23:55,809 --> 00:23:58,000
never know what it is actually so shift

531
00:23:58,000 --> 00:24:00,279
D duplicate that face as you can see you

532
00:24:00,279 --> 00:24:02,110
can pretty much take any face here that

533
00:24:02,110 --> 00:24:06,039
might seem suitable put it there

534
00:24:06,039 --> 00:24:08,590
I don't eat to extrude it I'm just gonna

535
00:24:08,590 --> 00:24:10,029
make a really simple plank here but I'll

536
00:24:10,029 --> 00:24:13,840
rescale it on a bit G to move it and

537
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,720
again we don't have to be picky that's

538
00:24:16,720 --> 00:24:20,770
the nice thing have I said the wonky or

539
00:24:20,770 --> 00:24:22,960
the better I think I did but we could

540
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:24,700
actually make it not go through so much

541
00:24:24,700 --> 00:24:26,140
show but I guess they they could have

542
00:24:26,140 --> 00:24:28,330
chopped it through now we'll do L to

543
00:24:28,330 --> 00:24:31,299
select those links and then here I can

544
00:24:31,299 --> 00:24:35,350
just move that onto that and now maybe

545
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:37,570
we wanted it to be that could be a bit

546
00:24:37,570 --> 00:24:39,309
thicker like that maybe you want to cut

547
00:24:39,309 --> 00:24:41,590
it like this as well actually control

548
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:44,890
our loop cut a few those control or

549
00:24:44,890 --> 00:24:49,000
we've got a few those and now with

550
00:24:49,000 --> 00:24:51,549
proportional oh I'll just pick a few

551
00:24:51,549 --> 00:24:56,110
these and we'll even make the railings

552
00:24:56,110 --> 00:24:59,320
here a bit won't you because who would

553
00:24:59,320 --> 00:25:00,940
have cut perfect plank like that if you

554
00:25:00,940 --> 00:25:02,350
build a house like this in a place like

555
00:25:02,350 --> 00:25:04,390
this with a builder like this I doubt

556
00:25:04,390 --> 00:25:07,539
that they'd be using straight planks and

557
00:25:07,539 --> 00:25:08,980
here we could do the same trick as well

558
00:25:08,980 --> 00:25:12,220
we'll do K to do a knife cut here let's

559
00:25:12,220 --> 00:25:14,020
add some of that geometry luckily enough

560
00:25:14,020 --> 00:25:17,200
the number of polygons compared to like

561
00:25:17,200 --> 00:25:20,110
non low poly arch this is so few

562
00:25:20,110 --> 00:25:21,779
polygons anyway that I wouldn't even

563
00:25:21,779 --> 00:25:24,820
flinch to use this on especially on a PC

564
00:25:24,820 --> 00:25:27,399
it's not a problem to have these

565
00:25:27,399 --> 00:25:29,770
vertices rendering I mean you have

566
00:25:29,770 --> 00:25:32,440
objects in some cases where the

567
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:35,049
characters alone are like hundreds of

568
00:25:35,049 --> 00:25:38,110
thousands of polygons and where I'll

569
00:25:38,110 --> 00:25:39,760
check now actually what counter we out

570
00:25:39,760 --> 00:25:41,440
node you can go brighter as well you

571
00:25:41,440 --> 00:25:43,010
know

572
00:25:43,010 --> 00:25:50,809
right let's do Kate let's make this

573
00:25:50,809 --> 00:25:54,200
brighter so G and step it up a bit there

574
00:25:54,200 --> 00:25:55,850
I works too actually in fact it looks

575
00:25:55,850 --> 00:25:58,850
even better so let's make that one

576
00:25:58,850 --> 00:26:00,679
brighter so we've got little bridge

577
00:26:00,679 --> 00:26:02,330
these are hanging in the air I guess I

578
00:26:02,330 --> 00:26:04,750
could fix that too

579
00:26:04,750 --> 00:26:07,370
let's make some beams here so I'll just

580
00:26:07,370 --> 00:26:08,929
hop into edit mode select that face

581
00:26:08,929 --> 00:26:10,760
shifty you know the drill

582
00:26:10,760 --> 00:26:13,280
I delete that you know fantastic shift

583
00:26:13,280 --> 00:26:16,669
the bring it down scale scale on the

584
00:26:16,669 --> 00:26:20,150
y-axis bring it down e to extrude on

585
00:26:20,150 --> 00:26:21,799
sometimes like now you can see that I've

586
00:26:21,799 --> 00:26:23,570
extrude it in the wrong direction so we

587
00:26:23,570 --> 00:26:25,220
made it to all the back faces facing out

588
00:26:25,220 --> 00:26:26,780
they use this way to fix that it's just

589
00:26:26,780 --> 00:26:28,250
to extrude it in the other direction is

590
00:26:28,250 --> 00:26:30,770
tough so that's the easiest way you

591
00:26:30,770 --> 00:26:32,090
could also flip the normals and stuff

592
00:26:32,090 --> 00:26:36,440
that's a bit of a pain okay there's one

593
00:26:36,440 --> 00:26:39,980
beam let's do shift the rotate rotate

594
00:26:39,980 --> 00:26:46,880
rotate on which axis white key to me

595
00:26:46,880 --> 00:26:48,850
whatever no no no that's okay

596
00:26:48,850 --> 00:26:54,350
no I've got something stupid L to select

597
00:26:54,350 --> 00:26:56,750
our own bar to rotate okay I don't know

598
00:26:56,750 --> 00:26:58,400
what key I press there but controls that

599
00:26:58,400 --> 00:27:01,100
will save you a lot of the time so we've

600
00:27:01,100 --> 00:27:02,990
got a lot British go in there should we

601
00:27:02,990 --> 00:27:04,730
make it we've already made a tree so I

602
00:27:04,730 --> 00:27:05,929
won't really do that but we could make

603
00:27:05,929 --> 00:27:08,150
some grass things growing here so I'll

604
00:27:08,150 --> 00:27:10,580
pick this face deep you know the drill

605
00:27:10,580 --> 00:27:12,770
scale it bring it to that scale it down

606
00:27:12,770 --> 00:27:16,040
even more and now change it to brighter

607
00:27:16,040 --> 00:27:18,290
green move it down and then here we do

608
00:27:18,290 --> 00:27:20,510
the right click to extrude s to scale

609
00:27:20,510 --> 00:27:23,390
right click extrude scale right click to

610
00:27:23,390 --> 00:27:25,850
extrude s to scale right click to

611
00:27:25,850 --> 00:27:28,340
extrude s to scale control our for loop

612
00:27:28,340 --> 00:27:30,770
cut there pick that one right click

613
00:27:30,770 --> 00:27:33,559
scale actually we'll press over

614
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:36,020
proportional here and then just right

615
00:27:36,020 --> 00:27:37,580
click and you can scale them all

616
00:27:37,580 --> 00:27:38,710
together there

617
00:27:38,710 --> 00:27:42,660
control our look at our scale its

618
00:27:42,660 --> 00:27:46,270
control right-click scale it's for like

619
00:27:46,270 --> 00:27:49,810
minutes so maybe this could be like some

620
00:27:49,810 --> 00:27:51,430
sort of adjusts grass thing growing

621
00:27:51,430 --> 00:27:57,280
there or something what else could we

622
00:27:57,280 --> 00:28:00,130
have we could have a barrel here maybe

623
00:28:00,130 --> 00:28:01,510
they need a barrel not that they need

624
00:28:01,510 --> 00:28:03,300
any more water but let's make apparel

625
00:28:03,300 --> 00:28:05,860
I'll just tick the same place here I'll

626
00:28:05,860 --> 00:28:07,990
pick this face shift D to duplicate it

627
00:28:07,990 --> 00:28:11,020
that's the scale move it up control I

628
00:28:11,020 --> 00:28:13,200
right-click it and subdivide it once

629
00:28:13,200 --> 00:28:15,610
then we've got our trusted F 3 and

630
00:28:15,610 --> 00:28:19,890
circle a circle going G move it to brown

631
00:28:19,890 --> 00:28:21,460
scale it down

632
00:28:21,460 --> 00:28:23,020
get off proportional now we'll just

633
00:28:23,020 --> 00:28:25,990
extrude the first up a bit for the base

634
00:28:25,990 --> 00:28:28,810
ring e to extrude again as to scale E to

635
00:28:28,810 --> 00:28:30,940
extrude that's the scale let's make a

636
00:28:30,940 --> 00:28:33,700
ring here e to extrude this is a big

637
00:28:33,700 --> 00:28:36,040
barrel I have to shrink it that's the

638
00:28:36,040 --> 00:28:38,890
scale e to extrude s to scale that's our

639
00:28:38,890 --> 00:28:40,810
old motto back isn't it

640
00:28:40,810 --> 00:28:43,450
I've said it so much lately I'm right

641
00:28:43,450 --> 00:28:45,070
clicking to extrude all sorts of weird

642
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:49,120
stuff that's no good is it so that's it

643
00:28:49,120 --> 00:28:53,050
and then we'll in I to insert like that

644
00:28:53,050 --> 00:28:54,850
need to extrude this could be let's just

645
00:28:54,850 --> 00:28:57,520
fill it with water as well shall we it's

646
00:28:57,520 --> 00:29:00,070
plenty of it alt to loop select that one

647
00:29:00,070 --> 00:29:02,530
shift and alt to add loop select on

648
00:29:02,530 --> 00:29:04,150
shift also like to shift all select

649
00:29:04,150 --> 00:29:07,860
faulty to extrude on face normals ctrl +

650
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:13,150
+ G great when they were got some sort

651
00:29:13,150 --> 00:29:17,450
of a barrel strange-looking barrel

652
00:29:17,450 --> 00:29:20,540
okay I'm a bit down today what else

653
00:29:20,540 --> 00:29:23,630
should we do a little puffy this could

654
00:29:23,630 --> 00:29:26,960
be very simple just cheap move it that's

655
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:27,350
it

656
00:29:27,350 --> 00:29:30,620
passed on just a different color smokes

657
00:29:30,620 --> 00:29:38,360
down here though you'll fall down okay

658
00:29:38,360 --> 00:29:41,800
we can link this path together without

659
00:29:44,550 --> 00:29:46,559
you randomized this moment of it I'm

660
00:29:46,559 --> 00:29:51,179
here let's see I want to pick this

661
00:29:51,179 --> 00:29:53,010
vertex old Zed then let's try to hunt

662
00:29:53,010 --> 00:30:05,090
this vertex now mission impossible

663
00:30:05,090 --> 00:30:07,350
but it wasn't impossible I just did it

664
00:30:07,350 --> 00:30:12,090
so maybe that one that one should we do

665
00:30:12,090 --> 00:30:14,730
it so yeah let's make this whole thing

666
00:30:14,730 --> 00:30:18,090
you can walk around the house nope

667
00:30:18,090 --> 00:30:21,030
oh yeah got another mission impossible

668
00:30:21,030 --> 00:30:24,450
there we're gonna hunt for the another

669
00:30:24,450 --> 00:30:26,670
vertex there a trick here is if it's

670
00:30:26,670 --> 00:30:27,960
difficult if you just looked at this

671
00:30:27,960 --> 00:30:29,070
picture it make no sense

672
00:30:29,070 --> 00:30:30,809
but if you rotate a little bit you can

673
00:30:30,809 --> 00:30:32,550
start picking out where the vertex is

674
00:30:32,550 --> 00:30:34,020
that you want and it's probably that one

675
00:30:34,020 --> 00:30:36,960
that we want yes and there's another one

676
00:30:36,960 --> 00:30:39,660
your hunt it they wrote tracking lock-on

677
00:30:39,660 --> 00:30:43,500
got it all set done and now this one's

678
00:30:43,500 --> 00:30:45,630
not fitting there is it so let's

679
00:30:45,630 --> 00:30:48,780
actually have some grass right there cuz

680
00:30:48,780 --> 00:30:50,250
I like that that it grows right on the

681
00:30:50,250 --> 00:30:51,600
corner for some reason the grass always

682
00:30:51,600 --> 00:30:53,910
grows at the corner it's difficult to

683
00:30:53,910 --> 00:30:55,650
cut there here let's make this look like

684
00:30:55,650 --> 00:30:57,870
the grass is sticking up a little bit so

685
00:30:57,870 --> 00:31:01,980
I'll select these and then e to extrude

686
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:05,040
it but let's extrude it down this one we

687
00:31:05,040 --> 00:31:07,410
have to fix I'm not too worried about

688
00:31:07,410 --> 00:31:11,630
the edge here because that's okay

689
00:31:11,880 --> 00:31:16,950
I say that and then I break it so I need

690
00:31:16,950 --> 00:31:18,750
to fix that we can't have this face

691
00:31:18,750 --> 00:31:21,840
coming like that can we no we can just

692
00:31:21,840 --> 00:31:23,190
delete that face select it

693
00:31:23,190 --> 00:31:25,590
delete face and then we figure out what

694
00:31:25,590 --> 00:31:27,809
to do here we can do switch on vertex

695
00:31:27,809 --> 00:31:31,169
nothing you and then do ctrl key and

696
00:31:31,169 --> 00:31:33,840
snap it to place there that's one way to

697
00:31:33,840 --> 00:31:36,169
fix it

698
00:31:36,169 --> 00:31:38,700
m2 merge by distance it removed five

699
00:31:38,700 --> 00:31:40,230
vertices here that were double that's

700
00:31:40,230 --> 00:31:42,750
okay then I'll just select that one

701
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:47,370
press f2 cap it and then dr. green as

702
00:31:47,370 --> 00:31:49,260
well so that's it I just wanted to go

703
00:31:49,260 --> 00:31:51,419
out there too and we can change these

704
00:31:51,419 --> 00:31:52,440
little bits so they're different

705
00:31:52,440 --> 00:31:55,169
thicknesses and not so uniformed just

706
00:31:55,169 --> 00:32:04,770
some manual shifting there okay this to

707
00:32:04,770 --> 00:32:06,630
be honest there's no right and wrong way

708
00:32:06,630 --> 00:32:09,679
of doing it as long as you do right no

709
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:13,080
you just pick whatever method works at

710
00:32:13,080 --> 00:32:14,940
the moment and if it works better for

711
00:32:14,940 --> 00:32:16,440
you to do it won't wait do it that way

712
00:32:16,440 --> 00:32:18,179
if it doesn't do it the other way okay

713
00:32:18,179 --> 00:32:19,590
well I've already done a tree in the

714
00:32:19,590 --> 00:32:20,789
other one so I'm not gonna bother to

715
00:32:20,789 --> 00:32:23,039
make it tree no maybe we can just make

716
00:32:23,039 --> 00:32:27,330
like a Ledge here so control has to say

717
00:32:27,330 --> 00:32:30,030
that on let's bring this up as if it's

718
00:32:30,030 --> 00:32:34,950
like an old corner here so maybe like

719
00:32:34,950 --> 00:32:37,950
this and then let's just go eat extrude

720
00:32:37,950 --> 00:32:43,230
that one and here we can do let's do

721
00:32:43,230 --> 00:32:45,780
mesh transform randomized but let's do

722
00:32:45,780 --> 00:32:49,049
it a lot more like this and then e to

723
00:32:49,049 --> 00:32:51,179
extrude again and let's randomize it

724
00:32:51,179 --> 00:32:55,620
again mesh transform randomize and slide

725
00:32:55,620 --> 00:32:57,659
it that's it

726
00:32:57,659 --> 00:33:01,950
and each extrude that one scale is that

727
00:33:01,950 --> 00:33:03,870
now if you want to flatten it again and

728
00:33:03,870 --> 00:33:06,179
then we'll do that I'll just do grass up

729
00:33:06,179 --> 00:33:11,580
here no scale or all to eat extra long

730
00:33:11,580 --> 00:33:15,220
face normals and bring it down like that

731
00:33:15,220 --> 00:33:18,040
grab a few of these as well scale and a

732
00:33:18,040 --> 00:33:19,480
bit differently how am i doing for a

733
00:33:19,480 --> 00:33:21,490
battery battery is nearly dead on my

734
00:33:21,490 --> 00:33:23,590
camera so I'm thinking that I've

735
00:33:23,590 --> 00:33:26,620
recorded probably enough bogus modeling

736
00:33:26,620 --> 00:33:28,600
now if you're still here on the premiere

737
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:31,660
thanks I didn't expect it to be this

738
00:33:31,660 --> 00:33:35,100
long but you're free to leave anytime

739
00:33:35,100 --> 00:33:38,530
it's makeup but I'm actually gonna

740
00:33:38,530 --> 00:33:41,500
finish off any moment though so I want

741
00:33:41,500 --> 00:33:46,150
to have it should I just do brown g2

742
00:33:46,150 --> 00:33:48,040
move on let's do some more randomness

743
00:33:48,040 --> 00:33:50,830
here Manuel randomness it's the worst

744
00:33:50,830 --> 00:33:52,720
time to randomness humans are not really

745
00:33:52,720 --> 00:33:55,330
good at trying to do stuff random it's

746
00:33:55,330 --> 00:33:56,590
all these song patterns that you're

747
00:33:56,590 --> 00:33:58,480
looking to do or something I'm not happy

748
00:33:58,480 --> 00:33:59,950
about that but that's okay you don't

749
00:33:59,950 --> 00:34:01,240
have to be happy with everything it's a

750
00:34:01,240 --> 00:34:02,470
bit difficult to see the house not maybe

751
00:34:02,470 --> 00:34:06,280
so let's move that one that vertex is

752
00:34:06,280 --> 00:34:08,290
really annoying me that one in

753
00:34:08,290 --> 00:34:08,800
particular

754
00:34:08,800 --> 00:34:10,870
in fact it annoys me so much that I

755
00:34:10,870 --> 00:34:14,530
might delete it and recreate this

756
00:34:14,530 --> 00:34:17,800
because it annoyed me that much and then

757
00:34:17,800 --> 00:34:18,969
I can show you that you don't have to be

758
00:34:18,969 --> 00:34:20,500
too worried about something breaks you

759
00:34:20,500 --> 00:34:23,500
can always repair it so if you wanted to

760
00:34:23,500 --> 00:34:25,960
repair this one you could select these

761
00:34:25,960 --> 00:34:28,360
press f2 no you don't want to do that

762
00:34:28,360 --> 00:34:30,340
let's just do this you could eat extrude

763
00:34:30,340 --> 00:34:32,409
this up let your vertex there's many

764
00:34:32,409 --> 00:34:35,290
ways to fix it press F fix that

765
00:34:35,290 --> 00:34:38,500
colorization there and then that's it

766
00:34:38,500 --> 00:34:40,090
and then you can link these together so

767
00:34:40,090 --> 00:34:43,900
like he's f2 link those and then you

768
00:34:43,900 --> 00:34:44,918
just wanted to show you that you don't

769
00:34:44,918 --> 00:34:47,080
have to be too afraid if something it's

770
00:34:47,080 --> 00:34:48,790
like weird like that if you managed to

771
00:34:48,790 --> 00:34:50,350
break the mesh you could just revert to

772
00:34:50,350 --> 00:34:52,270
your save file that's probably the best

773
00:34:52,270 --> 00:34:55,570
way but if you forgot to save some shift

774
00:34:55,570 --> 00:34:57,640
selecting those pressing F but then it

775
00:34:57,640 --> 00:35:00,430
does stretch this UV so you have to fix

776
00:35:00,430 --> 00:35:03,070
the UV like this but that's not the end

777
00:35:03,070 --> 00:35:06,700
of the world and then there we go you

778
00:35:06,700 --> 00:35:08,830
have to pick the right edges as well f2

779
00:35:08,830 --> 00:35:11,800
lot on mark that vertex

780
00:35:11,800 --> 00:35:14,350
and now I've successfully just deleted

781
00:35:14,350 --> 00:35:16,000
that vertex not annoying me and put it

782
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,130
back again just to show you that you can

783
00:35:18,130 --> 00:35:20,350
actually fix the topology if you manage

784
00:35:20,350 --> 00:35:21,820
to cut a hole don't panic

785
00:35:21,820 --> 00:35:25,660
use the different F to cap the holes and

786
00:35:25,660 --> 00:35:27,460
try to find the edges that should be

787
00:35:27,460 --> 00:35:29,170
connected and you'd be alright I think

788
00:35:29,170 --> 00:35:31,420
that's gonna be it for this week a lot

789
00:35:31,420 --> 00:35:33,340
of extra bonus material they're probably

790
00:35:33,340 --> 00:35:35,140
a bit more than I should have added but

791
00:35:35,140 --> 00:35:36,700
hopefully gave you some extra insight to

792
00:35:36,700 --> 00:35:38,200
do some modelling tips without the

793
00:35:38,200 --> 00:35:40,030
stress of doing it within the ten

794
00:35:40,030 --> 00:35:42,070
minutes but anyway please consider

795
00:35:42,070 --> 00:35:43,570
subscribing if you haven't done that

796
00:35:43,570 --> 00:35:45,370
already and hit like if you liked the

797
00:35:45,370 --> 00:35:47,380
video and I'll see you next week for

798
00:35:47,380 --> 00:35:51,070
another ten minute build alright bye for

799
00:35:51,070 --> 00:35:52,510
now have a good week

800
00:35:52,510 --> 00:35:54,700
squeak - check I've just hit the four

801
00:35:54,700 --> 00:35:56,500
percent barrier of female Watchers as

802
00:35:56,500 --> 00:35:58,240
well so thumbs up on that one and if

803
00:35:58,240 --> 00:36:03,720
insya was a woman she'd look like this

804
00:36:04,200 --> 00:36:10,830
okay that's it am I even in focus

805
00:36:12,660 --> 00:36:38,139
