00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:03,040
hello guys and welcome to episode 70 of

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,640
the 10 minute modeling challenge can you

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,279
believe it

4
00:00:05,279 --> 00:00:08,639
i cannot 70 episodes 70 thursdays have

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,160
gone past since we started this whole

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,440
journey while i've been doing these

7
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,480
thursday videos

8
00:00:12,480 --> 00:00:15,679
i've in my day job that's making a game

9
00:00:15,679 --> 00:00:17,279
as well so i'm making a real-time

10
00:00:17,279 --> 00:00:19,680
strategy games with a colleague of mine

11
00:00:19,680 --> 00:00:22,880
it's me and christian we're making a

12
00:00:22,880 --> 00:00:25,840
fully-fledged multiplayer rts game with

13
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:26,800
lots of ai

14
00:00:26,800 --> 00:00:28,960
and lots of netcode a lot of procedural

15
00:00:28,960 --> 00:00:30,000
generation

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,399
and in this game i'm actually been

17
00:00:32,399 --> 00:00:33,040
making

18
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,200
some 3d objects of course well a lot of

19
00:00:35,200 --> 00:00:36,880
my part there is actually programming

20
00:00:36,880 --> 00:00:39,360
believe it or not so i spend maybe 80

21
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,399
percent of my time

22
00:00:40,399 --> 00:00:42,800
developing programming and maybe 20 is

23
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,559
all the rest which is uh like graphics

24
00:00:44,559 --> 00:00:45,840
3d stuff

25
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,559
and the game objects and doing uh sound

26
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:50,000
effects and things like that and music

27
00:00:50,000 --> 00:00:50,559
of course

28
00:00:50,559 --> 00:00:52,800
but in this game uh we're making some uh

29
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:53,600
like rts

30
00:00:53,600 --> 00:00:55,680
styled buildings or structures and some

31
00:00:55,680 --> 00:00:57,680
of them are just static buildings like a

32
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:58,079
city

33
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:00,559
or a little town for example but we also

34
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,320
have some producing buildings and that

35
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,320
could be like factories or barracks or

36
00:01:04,320 --> 00:01:05,439
airports and i thought

37
00:01:05,439 --> 00:01:07,200
i'd give you a little a quick show how

38
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:09,280
you can make a rts styled

39
00:01:09,280 --> 00:01:11,439
building in about 10 minutes so that's

40
00:01:11,439 --> 00:01:13,200
going to be the usual time limit of

41
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:13,920
course

42
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:15,360
and i'm going to do it just a little bit

43
00:01:15,360 --> 00:01:17,520
modular so you can animate the

44
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:19,119
construction of an object like that and

45
00:01:19,119 --> 00:01:20,720
i want to keep it simple because usually

46
00:01:20,720 --> 00:01:22,960
in rts games especially

47
00:01:22,960 --> 00:01:24,320
especially if you were to play on a

48
00:01:24,320 --> 00:01:26,240
mobile we're not making a mobile game

49
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,080
but then the buildings are going to be

50
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:30,079
quite small and also in our game they're

51
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,439
quite small regardless because you can't

52
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,280
really zoom in too close

53
00:01:33,280 --> 00:01:35,200
so you get away with the low poly

54
00:01:35,200 --> 00:01:36,799
objects they'll render fast and they'll

55
00:01:36,799 --> 00:01:37,759
look pretty good

56
00:01:37,759 --> 00:01:40,000
from a distance let's do a low poly

57
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:41,759
factory building or an rts

58
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:45,439
style game here we go i'm using the old

59
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,280
palette today i'm not using the gradient

60
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,280
and sometimes it's actually better to

61
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:51,520
use this static with fewer colors

62
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:51,920
because

63
00:01:51,920 --> 00:01:54,000
then you get a consistent look to all

64
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:55,200
your objects so you don't have

65
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:57,280
loads of different shades and everything

66
00:01:57,280 --> 00:01:58,960
and sometimes you can go even fewer a

67
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,799
lot fewer colors in fact you can go down

68
00:02:00,799 --> 00:02:03,280
to 16 colors and get that retro style

69
00:02:03,280 --> 00:02:04,960
and it's quite cool when all the objects

70
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:08,080
are really fitting the same palette

71
00:02:08,080 --> 00:02:09,599
so i'm gonna go for the old school here

72
00:02:09,599 --> 00:02:11,680
the eight by eight so it's still 64

73
00:02:11,680 --> 00:02:12,319
colors

74
00:02:12,319 --> 00:02:14,640
but let's do that one and uh let's get

75
00:02:14,640 --> 00:02:16,080
started

76
00:02:16,080 --> 00:02:19,760
so screencast keys we need to enable and

77
00:02:19,760 --> 00:02:22,480
we're gonna be off now hold on to your

78
00:02:22,480 --> 00:02:23,280
hats

79
00:02:23,280 --> 00:02:25,120
why is there no skipping oh yeah there

80
00:02:25,120 --> 00:02:26,720
we go ready steady

81
00:02:26,720 --> 00:02:30,160
go and we are off timer's off usually i

82
00:02:30,160 --> 00:02:31,440
keep the base of the building

83
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:33,440
underground like this um it's

84
00:02:33,440 --> 00:02:35,360
uh quite good when you have uneven

85
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,040
terrain to put it on

86
00:02:37,040 --> 00:02:38,319
and then what i'm going to do is keep

87
00:02:38,319 --> 00:02:40,160
just a base plate here i'll do shift d

88
00:02:40,160 --> 00:02:42,560
to duplicate it i do a lot of this and i

89
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:44,239
recommend that you don't build

90
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:46,080
everything into the same structure in

91
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,319
fact so we'll make like a little side

92
00:02:48,319 --> 00:02:50,239
building here for the factory

93
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,000
select this one e to extrude this one of

94
00:02:52,000 --> 00:02:53,280
course and then

95
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:55,680
shift d to duplicate this one and then

96
00:02:55,680 --> 00:02:56,480
maybe i'll let's

97
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,519
scale it down scale it on the x-axis so

98
00:02:59,519 --> 00:02:59,840
press

99
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:02,319
x to force it scale it up again we'll

100
00:03:02,319 --> 00:03:04,000
put a little side thing here angle

101
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:06,159
e to extrude that one so we've got two

102
00:03:06,159 --> 00:03:08,239
basic portions of this building

103
00:03:08,239 --> 00:03:09,920
here we can make it like an entry so

104
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:12,640
i'll ctrl r twice to do some loop cuts

105
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,319
ctrl r here as well

106
00:03:14,319 --> 00:03:16,640
and ctrl r and here i'll just extrude

107
00:03:16,640 --> 00:03:18,640
this one in

108
00:03:18,640 --> 00:03:20,400
and here on the factory should we do

109
00:03:20,400 --> 00:03:21,840
maybe like we'll do

110
00:03:21,840 --> 00:03:24,879
shift d to duplicate it s to scale it s

111
00:03:24,879 --> 00:03:25,440
to scale

112
00:03:25,440 --> 00:03:28,000
press y to scale on the y axis e to

113
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:29,120
extrude this one up

114
00:03:29,120 --> 00:03:31,440
i to inset and e to extrude it down i

115
00:03:31,440 --> 00:03:32,560
usually like to make

116
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:35,200
roofs like this shift d to duplicate

117
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:35,760
that one

118
00:03:35,760 --> 00:03:39,519
scale it down scale x instead of just uh

119
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,120
working from the same object i quite

120
00:03:41,120 --> 00:03:43,360
often now separate the geometry i'm

121
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:44,879
still in the same object but i separate

122
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,319
the geometry like this

123
00:03:46,319 --> 00:03:47,760
so we'll keep this one here maybe we'll

124
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:50,080
put ctrl r loop cut here

125
00:03:50,080 --> 00:03:52,319
select this one on edge select a little

126
00:03:52,319 --> 00:03:53,680
maybe

127
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
anything like that let's put some things

128
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,959
here as well shift d

129
00:03:56,959 --> 00:04:00,239
first scale it up scale on the y-axis

130
00:04:00,239 --> 00:04:02,879
and we'll do similar type of the roof

131
00:04:02,879 --> 00:04:04,319
here e to extrude

132
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:07,280
eye to inset heat texture down you can

133
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:08,480
start to colorize this

134
00:04:08,480 --> 00:04:10,400
l to select all these linked go for a

135
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,080
darker gray maybe even black for the

136
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:12,959
root here

137
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:16,000
or a darker green like this and let's

138
00:04:16,000 --> 00:04:17,440
put some features on it as well like

139
00:04:17,440 --> 00:04:18,160
chimneys

140
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,199
usually on like a like a

141
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,680
factory so shifty duplicate s scale on

142
00:04:23,680 --> 00:04:25,280
the x-axis

143
00:04:25,280 --> 00:04:27,520
scale x-axis again and here i'll just

144
00:04:27,520 --> 00:04:28,720
move it into the building

145
00:04:28,720 --> 00:04:31,199
and e to extrude it out to here then

146
00:04:31,199 --> 00:04:33,280
i'll e to extrude this one out

147
00:04:33,280 --> 00:04:34,720
move this one in to get like a little

148
00:04:34,720 --> 00:04:36,560
bevel here

149
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:39,360
and let's move this one and here i'll

150
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:40,880
make that chimney and this one i'm going

151
00:04:40,880 --> 00:04:42,720
to put in our game we've put like little

152
00:04:42,720 --> 00:04:43,120
uh

153
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,440
color accents depending if you're like

154
00:04:45,440 --> 00:04:47,120
depending if you're blue or red players

155
00:04:47,120 --> 00:04:48,880
so let's just do the same here

156
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:50,720
create this one blue and then i'll do

157
00:04:50,720 --> 00:04:52,400
shift d to duplicate this one

158
00:04:52,400 --> 00:04:54,000
i'm going to put a chimney i'll offset

159
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,320
this one a little bit e to extrude it up

160
00:04:56,320 --> 00:04:59,040
e to extrude s to scale e to extrude and

161
00:04:59,040 --> 00:05:01,759
s to scale it down that's the chimney

162
00:05:01,759 --> 00:05:05,039
gemini and we'll make that one gray

163
00:05:05,039 --> 00:05:07,280
a little bit lighter maybe and here i

164
00:05:07,280 --> 00:05:08,160
turn set

165
00:05:08,160 --> 00:05:10,320
and e to extrude down control plus to

166
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:11,600
grow the selection from down there and

167
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,199
make that dark this is usually i do

168
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:13,919
cavities

169
00:05:13,919 --> 00:05:17,360
inside there so maybe this could be as

170
00:05:17,360 --> 00:05:18,639
simple as this because we're going to

171
00:05:18,639 --> 00:05:20,080
look at it from a distance

172
00:05:20,080 --> 00:05:22,000
so i'll copy this whole thing now shift

173
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,080
d to duplicate that chimney put another

174
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:25,280
one here

175
00:05:25,280 --> 00:05:27,120
and let's just put the same type of

176
00:05:27,120 --> 00:05:29,440
accent here on this side as well shift d

177
00:05:29,440 --> 00:05:31,520
as if this was like a side building or

178
00:05:31,520 --> 00:05:33,120
something

179
00:05:33,120 --> 00:05:37,840
so scale z and e to extrude this one out

180
00:05:37,840 --> 00:05:40,560
maybe we'll go in a little bit over the

181
00:05:40,560 --> 00:05:44,240
building itself here and ctrl r to loop

182
00:05:44,240 --> 00:05:44,880
cut it

183
00:05:44,880 --> 00:05:47,680
and move this one in and l to select it

184
00:05:47,680 --> 00:05:50,240
and here's the nice thing now with the

185
00:05:50,240 --> 00:05:52,720
pallets because i can go for the same

186
00:05:52,720 --> 00:05:54,080
blue and in fact i'm gonna go for the

187
00:05:54,080 --> 00:05:54,720
same blue

188
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:57,520
so i don't lie let's put two accents

189
00:05:57,520 --> 00:05:59,199
here

190
00:05:59,199 --> 00:06:01,440
i don't know why i call them accents

191
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:02,319
well

192
00:06:02,319 --> 00:06:04,000
like little trims on the side of the

193
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,160
building there we go and

194
00:06:06,160 --> 00:06:09,039
here inside we'll do it dark so alt

195
00:06:09,039 --> 00:06:10,720
shift select there shift like that one

196
00:06:10,720 --> 00:06:11,120
and

197
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:14,319
again simulate that it's a hole there

198
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:16,880
and here shift the let's put some

199
00:06:16,880 --> 00:06:18,479
accessories here as well we've got six

200
00:06:18,479 --> 00:06:20,400
minutes on the clock there scale

201
00:06:20,400 --> 00:06:23,520
said i'll just e to extrude this one

202
00:06:23,520 --> 00:06:25,440
and let's pretend there's like some i

203
00:06:25,440 --> 00:06:27,680
don't know maybe it's like some

204
00:06:27,680 --> 00:06:29,600
i don't think they have air conditioning

205
00:06:29,600 --> 00:06:32,560
here but shifty duplicate

206
00:06:32,560 --> 00:06:34,080
this could be like some sort of a pipe

207
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:35,680
that goes up help

208
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,120
selecting there and

209
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:40,800
should we do like a ramp here need to

210
00:06:40,800 --> 00:06:42,160
extrude that on

211
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,160
i need to extrude that one down and

212
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,680
maybe the base plate here could be a bit

213
00:06:45,680 --> 00:06:48,479
darker as well

214
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:52,160
and here we could do maybe i'll do ctrl

215
00:06:52,160 --> 00:06:55,520
r loop cut ctrl r loop cut we can add a

216
00:06:55,520 --> 00:06:57,440
little bit more geometry now

217
00:06:57,440 --> 00:07:01,039
and here here is one thing i want to

218
00:07:01,039 --> 00:07:02,080
make these smaller so

219
00:07:02,080 --> 00:07:05,919
scale y just compress them into there

220
00:07:05,919 --> 00:07:09,919
ctrl r and here we'll do like

221
00:07:09,919 --> 00:07:12,080
could be like windows or something so i

222
00:07:12,080 --> 00:07:13,680
to inset

223
00:07:13,680 --> 00:07:15,680
all d to extrude long phase normals

224
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,520
inwards

225
00:07:17,520 --> 00:07:20,160
and it creates a little bit of a strange

226
00:07:20,160 --> 00:07:21,919
thing here we can actually fix that one

227
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:24,720
switch this one to vertex hold the

228
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:25,599
control

229
00:07:25,599 --> 00:07:29,120
key as you move this line and snap it to

230
00:07:29,120 --> 00:07:31,360
that vertex and then do the same thing

231
00:07:31,360 --> 00:07:33,759
here move it and snap to that vertex

232
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:35,120
maybe there's a better way to do this

233
00:07:35,120 --> 00:07:37,680
but you can snap it to the axis of the

234
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:39,280
different vertices there

235
00:07:39,280 --> 00:07:42,400
shifts like these and control plus let's

236
00:07:42,400 --> 00:07:45,520
just make this slightly darker

237
00:07:45,520 --> 00:07:48,479
there ctrl minus and then do black there

238
00:07:48,479 --> 00:07:49,440
maybe

239
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:51,199
so that could be and then here i want to

240
00:07:51,199 --> 00:07:52,639
have some feature as well ctrl

241
00:07:52,639 --> 00:07:55,440
r to cut alt shift select that one for

242
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:56,160
edge select

243
00:07:56,160 --> 00:07:59,280
all the extrude long face normals and i

244
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:00,479
also want to do something with this

245
00:08:00,479 --> 00:08:01,680
corner here so 4

246
00:08:01,680 --> 00:08:04,720
26 on the clock let's do some corner

247
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:06,000
stuff here

248
00:08:06,000 --> 00:08:08,879
pick this one shift d duplicate e to

249
00:08:08,879 --> 00:08:09,840
extrude

250
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:12,879
l to select the linked

251
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,360
and bring it down to there and these are

252
00:08:15,360 --> 00:08:16,160
just going to be like

253
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:19,199
corner trims so we l to select linked

254
00:08:19,199 --> 00:08:20,319
and we'll make them

255
00:08:20,319 --> 00:08:24,560
darker as well and

256
00:08:24,560 --> 00:08:27,120
l to select the linked let's manually

257
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:28,960
put this roughly on all corners here

258
00:08:28,960 --> 00:08:31,520
shift d these will have to be taller i

259
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,000
suppose

260
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:37,760
so let's move that on into there and up

261
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:39,440
to there

262
00:08:39,440 --> 00:08:42,640
and l to select those links shift the

263
00:08:42,640 --> 00:08:45,600
duplicator shift d to duplicate that and

264
00:08:45,600 --> 00:08:46,480
this one

265
00:08:46,480 --> 00:08:47,839
obviously we can't put it all the way

266
00:08:47,839 --> 00:08:49,360
over there but we'll stick one here on

267
00:08:49,360 --> 00:08:50,959
this corner

268
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,880
go in a bit under the roof

269
00:08:54,880 --> 00:08:58,399
and out a bit

270
00:08:58,399 --> 00:09:00,720
to there and then shift the maybe we'll

271
00:09:00,720 --> 00:09:02,560
just put one at the bottom or maybe we

272
00:09:02,560 --> 00:09:04,000
can even leave it like that that

273
00:09:04,000 --> 00:09:07,360
pretty cool i guess a little corner beam

274
00:09:07,360 --> 00:09:07,680
there

275
00:09:07,680 --> 00:09:10,800
we could keep it like that uh maybe

276
00:09:10,800 --> 00:09:12,000
we'll do something with the roof a lot

277
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,000
of maybes here so maybe shift d

278
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:17,040
to duplicate it s to scale it up bro

279
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:18,959
bring it down all the extrude long face

280
00:09:18,959 --> 00:09:20,640
normals this is an old school

281
00:09:20,640 --> 00:09:23,920
roof on a modern building

282
00:09:23,920 --> 00:09:28,320
dark and could do

283
00:09:28,320 --> 00:09:30,800
or really do anything fancy here i think

284
00:09:30,800 --> 00:09:32,560
but here we'll put

285
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:36,000
like solar panel style things so

286
00:09:36,000 --> 00:09:38,800
e to extrude that one bring this one

287
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:40,480
down

288
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:43,760
ctrl r let's loop cut it maybe just m

289
00:09:43,760 --> 00:09:44,320
times

290
00:09:44,320 --> 00:09:46,480
i to insert item set again to get the

291
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,320
individual and then just do them pitch

292
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,160
black there

293
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:52,240
and i think i'll do this whole thing

294
00:09:52,240 --> 00:09:53,680
brighter so

295
00:09:53,680 --> 00:09:56,800
for some contrast even brighter maybe

296
00:09:56,800 --> 00:10:00,240
l there we go l to select the link to

297
00:10:00,240 --> 00:10:00,800
shift the

298
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:04,000
duplicator and there's another part of

299
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,360
the structure there

300
00:10:05,360 --> 00:10:07,200
and another thing that i like to put on

301
00:10:07,200 --> 00:10:08,720
the top of the buildings usually is just

302
00:10:08,720 --> 00:10:09,200
some

303
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:12,000
small little really simple objects here

304
00:10:12,000 --> 00:10:12,399
so

305
00:10:12,399 --> 00:10:15,519
simple squares here eat extrude

306
00:10:15,519 --> 00:10:17,360
out select links go a little bit

307
00:10:17,360 --> 00:10:19,839
brighter

308
00:10:20,320 --> 00:10:22,560
and shift d to duplicate that one and

309
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,079
we've got two minutes on the clock so we

310
00:10:24,079 --> 00:10:25,680
can just keep working here

311
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:28,399
let's put a little fake ground here

312
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,560
shift d to duplicate this one

313
00:10:30,560 --> 00:10:33,440
s to scale it up and now i think i want

314
00:10:33,440 --> 00:10:34,399
to

315
00:10:34,399 --> 00:10:38,000
bring it down slightly there we go

316
00:10:38,000 --> 00:10:39,839
and we'll color right this should we do

317
00:10:39,839 --> 00:10:41,440
green just to simulate that it was on a

318
00:10:41,440 --> 00:10:42,240
green

319
00:10:42,240 --> 00:10:44,640
plot of land or should we go brown no

320
00:10:44,640 --> 00:10:45,600
green that is

321
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:48,720
but brighter green maybe

322
00:10:50,079 --> 00:10:52,240
and now you can if you've got the time

323
00:10:52,240 --> 00:10:53,760
now which we do we can add a little bit

324
00:10:53,760 --> 00:10:54,560
more detail

325
00:10:54,560 --> 00:10:57,440
let's slant that one maybe and to make a

326
00:10:57,440 --> 00:10:58,560
consistence

327
00:10:58,560 --> 00:11:00,240
i'll delete these instead of just trying

328
00:11:00,240 --> 00:11:02,000
to do the same thing i can do the same

329
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,519
on this one maybe

330
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:08,000
slant this one and we've got 127 so

331
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,600
l to select the link i'll select the

332
00:11:09,600 --> 00:11:13,040
link shift d to duplicate that

333
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,600
and here as well we've got some time so

334
00:11:15,600 --> 00:11:17,360
should we do something here

335
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:20,160
i i like to keep the primitive style but

336
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:20,800
maybe there's

337
00:11:20,800 --> 00:11:23,279
something lacking in here we can tilt

338
00:11:23,279 --> 00:11:26,480
this slope a little bit

339
00:11:26,720 --> 00:11:28,240
make a little bit more interesting and i

340
00:11:28,240 --> 00:11:30,000
think it's lacking something in here so

341
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:31,360
i'll also do

342
00:11:31,360 --> 00:11:34,399
uh shifty duplicate the face

343
00:11:34,399 --> 00:11:36,480
move it into there just looked a little

344
00:11:36,480 --> 00:11:38,000
bit empty here

345
00:11:38,000 --> 00:11:41,279
so e to extrude it

346
00:11:41,279 --> 00:11:43,279
and again i'm working with a separate

347
00:11:43,279 --> 00:11:46,079
piece of the geometry here

348
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,519
and that should be okay control r

349
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,920
control r let's move this one into

350
00:11:53,920 --> 00:11:56,000
just a bit a little bit more interesting

351
00:11:56,000 --> 00:11:57,279
there maybe

352
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,040
we don't have any doors or entries

353
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:01,920
that's not really needed either

354
00:12:01,920 --> 00:12:03,440
and we'll put one more object here i've

355
00:12:03,440 --> 00:12:06,959
got 24 seconds we can just put some

356
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,200
a little bit more trimmings again super

357
00:12:09,200 --> 00:12:10,880
primitive objects here

358
00:12:10,880 --> 00:12:12,160
we'll see from a distance when we're

359
00:12:12,160 --> 00:12:13,440
done now that it should look pretty good

360
00:12:13,440 --> 00:12:15,519
i think

361
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:17,600
you might not think so but from a

362
00:12:17,600 --> 00:12:19,279
distance it will look good

363
00:12:19,279 --> 00:12:22,720
maybe or good enough at least

364
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:25,920
five seconds to go and

365
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:27,680
a bit empty there maybe but i think

366
00:12:27,680 --> 00:12:29,200
we're okay

367
00:12:29,200 --> 00:12:32,240
that's it time's up

368
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,320
and we've made these type of buildings

369
00:12:34,320 --> 00:12:36,000
for the rts game and as they are

370
00:12:36,000 --> 00:12:37,120
constructed

371
00:12:37,120 --> 00:12:39,279
i've created a little animation for them

372
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
and part of the animation is that the

373
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:42,959
different parts of the buildings

374
00:12:42,959 --> 00:12:45,120
sort of appear from the ground and it's

375
00:12:45,120 --> 00:12:47,360
also creating like a scaffolding around

376
00:12:47,360 --> 00:12:48,240
the building and

377
00:12:48,240 --> 00:12:50,480
it's got an arm that moves around like a

378
00:12:50,480 --> 00:12:51,519
robotic arm that

379
00:12:51,519 --> 00:12:53,600
puts some weld sparks and i'll just show

380
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:55,279
a little part of how you can animate

381
00:12:55,279 --> 00:12:57,600
something like that inside of blender

382
00:12:57,600 --> 00:12:59,279
and one way to do it if we go to the

383
00:12:59,279 --> 00:13:01,519
animation tab let's get the

384
00:13:01,519 --> 00:13:03,680
look and feel here the same way shadow

385
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:04,560
cavity

386
00:13:04,560 --> 00:13:06,320
you don't know what the cavity settings

387
00:13:06,320 --> 00:13:07,760
is it's what makes this

388
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:10,480
little shiny edges and stuff here we'll

389
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:11,279
put those on

390
00:13:11,279 --> 00:13:13,519
i usually have that when i model and now

391
00:13:13,519 --> 00:13:15,120
that we've got that one way to do it it

392
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,959
would be to set let's set the timeline

393
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:20,000
to maybe like 90 frames or something

394
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,560
and we've got everything is just in one

395
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,839
object so the first thing we need to do

396
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:24,720
is separate it

397
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,959
so i'll select the ground here p and

398
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:28,000
separate that

399
00:13:28,000 --> 00:13:30,639
let's rename that to ground and then

400
00:13:30,639 --> 00:13:31,519
let's call this one

401
00:13:31,519 --> 00:13:35,600
factory and now i need to

402
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:38,720
select everything and do p and do by

403
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,639
loose parts and now it's created all of

404
00:13:40,639 --> 00:13:42,480
these are separate objects now

405
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:44,800
so one way there's the camera so one way

406
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:45,760
to do it

407
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,920
is to animate the different objects like

408
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,519
this and there's some

409
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:51,519
maybe it's one easy way to do it but

410
00:13:51,519 --> 00:13:52,880
it's got some drawbacks but i'll show

411
00:13:52,880 --> 00:13:53,920
you anyway

412
00:13:53,920 --> 00:13:56,000
you could select all the objects here's

413
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:56,959
a little tip as well

414
00:13:56,959 --> 00:13:58,720
if you don't want to accidentally select

415
00:13:58,720 --> 00:14:00,079
the ground here all the time you can go

416
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:01,120
to this little filter

417
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:04,560
and enable this selectable and then for

418
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,160
the ground here we can untick this

419
00:14:06,160 --> 00:14:06,480
little

420
00:14:06,480 --> 00:14:08,079
now it's impossible to select this

421
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:09,600
unless you switch that one back on and

422
00:14:09,600 --> 00:14:11,440
it even works if you press a to select

423
00:14:11,440 --> 00:14:12,720
everything it excludes

424
00:14:12,720 --> 00:14:14,959
that one it's not possible to select it

425
00:14:14,959 --> 00:14:16,079
intentionally or by

426
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:18,000
mistake so with all these objects now

427
00:14:18,000 --> 00:14:20,160
let's press a to select all of them

428
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,079
and then i'm going to put on automatic

429
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,600
keyframing here and i'm going to go to

430
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:24,240
the

431
00:14:24,240 --> 00:14:26,000
let's see we'll go to the first frame

432
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:27,600
here i'm going to

433
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:29,519
do shift space and g and then i'm going

434
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,360
to move these down here

435
00:14:31,360 --> 00:14:33,680
and that creates a state now for all of

436
00:14:33,680 --> 00:14:36,000
these to be animated outside of view

437
00:14:36,000 --> 00:14:39,040
and then we'll go to frame 90 here and

438
00:14:39,040 --> 00:14:39,760
i'll do alt

439
00:14:39,760 --> 00:14:42,560
g and alt g brings the box to brings it

440
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,560
back to the default location

441
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:46,959
so if we were to play this one now it'll

442
00:14:46,959 --> 00:14:48,639
just slide the whole building up and

443
00:14:48,639 --> 00:14:50,240
that's not really what we want we want a

444
00:14:50,240 --> 00:14:52,399
little bit more modular

445
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:54,160
so one way to do that would be to go to

446
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,320
frame five for example

447
00:14:56,320 --> 00:14:58,399
let's do alt z so we see through and

448
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,000
then we'll take this base plate down

449
00:15:00,000 --> 00:15:00,720
here

450
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,199
and on frame five with automatic

451
00:15:03,199 --> 00:15:04,959
keyframing i'm gonna go alt

452
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,880
g and that brings that back to the

453
00:15:06,880 --> 00:15:08,959
proper location for this one

454
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:11,279
and if we were to press play now that

455
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:12,079
one will animate

456
00:15:12,079 --> 00:15:15,440
up from zero or from one here to five

457
00:15:15,440 --> 00:15:16,720
really quick

458
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,320
and then you could animate up the next

459
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,399
one so with the old set to see through

460
00:15:20,399 --> 00:15:21,120
and let's put

461
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:23,680
this part to the building of frame ten

462
00:15:23,680 --> 00:15:24,560
i'll do all g

463
00:15:24,560 --> 00:15:26,560
on that one and that will bring it up to

464
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,399
here and if we press play now

465
00:15:28,399 --> 00:15:31,600
old said to disable c3 we see that they

466
00:15:31,600 --> 00:15:32,079
too

467
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,240
they're just popping up like this now

468
00:15:34,240 --> 00:15:35,519
and what you could do to make it a

469
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:36,959
little bit more interesting

470
00:15:36,959 --> 00:15:38,720
if we first of all i think i'll move

471
00:15:38,720 --> 00:15:40,000
this keyframe a little bit further

472
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:41,759
in so we'll go frame 10 for that one

473
00:15:41,759 --> 00:15:43,199
just to show you how it works

474
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:45,759
and this one will move to frame 20.

475
00:15:45,759 --> 00:15:47,920
let's play that one again

476
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:50,240
and here what you could do then is

477
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:51,839
you'll see that both of them start

478
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:52,560
moving at this

479
00:15:52,560 --> 00:15:54,000
point it's a bit difficult to see but

480
00:15:54,000 --> 00:15:55,759
both of them start moving at the same

481
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:56,320
time

482
00:15:56,320 --> 00:15:57,920
and if you want them to appear at the

483
00:15:57,920 --> 00:15:59,839
same rate that's uh

484
00:15:59,839 --> 00:16:02,240
not so ideal one way to do it is just to

485
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:03,440
move this keyframe

486
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:06,160
g to frame 10 here for this particular

487
00:16:06,160 --> 00:16:06,720
building

488
00:16:06,720 --> 00:16:08,639
now that one won't slide up until it

489
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:11,279
starts here from frame 10.

490
00:16:11,279 --> 00:16:14,000
so let's press play we'll see appear up

491
00:16:14,000 --> 00:16:15,040
here

492
00:16:15,040 --> 00:16:17,519
and another thing i do to exaggerate a

493
00:16:17,519 --> 00:16:18,880
little bit one of the

494
00:16:18,880 --> 00:16:20,560
principles of animations is that you

495
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,000
should exaggerate

496
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,399
and uh one thing that i like to do then

497
00:16:24,399 --> 00:16:25,040
is

498
00:16:25,040 --> 00:16:27,600
on frame eight for example here we'll do

499
00:16:27,600 --> 00:16:29,040
outside again to see through i should

500
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:30,240
actually put on the

501
00:16:30,240 --> 00:16:34,240
screencast keys here so on frame eight

502
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:35,680
i'm gonna do alt g again

503
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:38,639
and i'm going to move it above above a

504
00:16:38,639 --> 00:16:40,079
little bit like this

505
00:16:40,079 --> 00:16:42,079
and same thing for this second building

506
00:16:42,079 --> 00:16:43,680
we'll go to frame

507
00:16:43,680 --> 00:16:45,519
so two two frames before that one's

508
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:46,720
finished alt g

509
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,720
and move it a little bit too high and

510
00:16:48,720 --> 00:16:50,079
then back down

511
00:16:50,079 --> 00:16:51,680
so now it does like a little dent like

512
00:16:51,680 --> 00:16:53,279
this up and down

513
00:16:53,279 --> 00:16:57,199
and if we play this back it'll go up up

514
00:16:57,199 --> 00:16:58,639
and then you just keep doing this for

515
00:16:58,639 --> 00:17:02,240
all the objects all said

516
00:17:02,320 --> 00:17:03,519
we could bring this one up next for

517
00:17:03,519 --> 00:17:05,520
example and remember now that we want to

518
00:17:05,520 --> 00:17:06,319
move this

519
00:17:06,319 --> 00:17:08,720
keyframe the start keyframe to frame 20

520
00:17:08,720 --> 00:17:10,400
so it starts at the same base otherwise

521
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:10,880
they'll

522
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:13,839
gradually change their pacing so from

523
00:17:13,839 --> 00:17:14,240
frame

524
00:17:14,240 --> 00:17:18,079
20 here we'll go to frame 30 alt g

525
00:17:18,079 --> 00:17:20,959
and then i'll go back two steps alt g

526
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:21,360
again

527
00:17:21,360 --> 00:17:23,600
and move it a little bit too high and

528
00:17:23,600 --> 00:17:25,039
then we should really repeat that for

529
00:17:25,039 --> 00:17:26,400
all the objects but this is what the

530
00:17:26,400 --> 00:17:28,160
animation would look like

531
00:17:28,160 --> 00:17:31,600
it starts to modularly build the object

532
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:33,440
one of the downsides to doing this when

533
00:17:33,440 --> 00:17:35,280
you're constructing a factory like this

534
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:36,160
or a structure

535
00:17:36,160 --> 00:17:38,080
is that you'll end up with a whole bunch

536
00:17:38,080 --> 00:17:39,520
of different actions

537
00:17:39,520 --> 00:17:41,200
spread out over all the different

538
00:17:41,200 --> 00:17:43,280
objects so

539
00:17:43,280 --> 00:17:45,039
if you're going to animate it inside a

540
00:17:45,039 --> 00:17:47,200
blender i would instead recommend that

541
00:17:47,200 --> 00:17:47,840
you keep

542
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:49,520
everything here as one object like we

543
00:17:49,520 --> 00:17:51,520
did before and then you create an

544
00:17:51,520 --> 00:17:53,120
r mature instead like we've done with a

545
00:17:53,120 --> 00:17:55,039
lot of the characters and then you do

546
00:17:55,039 --> 00:17:56,240
detached bones

547
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,840
in the side of the different building

548
00:17:57,840 --> 00:18:00,240
parts and you map the building parts to

549
00:18:00,240 --> 00:18:01,360
those bones

550
00:18:01,360 --> 00:18:03,600
and then you animate those up and the

551
00:18:03,600 --> 00:18:05,120
same way as you did with this one but

552
00:18:05,120 --> 00:18:06,720
the benefit then is that everything is

553
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,640
going to be inside of one action

554
00:18:08,640 --> 00:18:10,400
and it's going to be one object so it's

555
00:18:10,400 --> 00:18:11,919
a much simpler thing if you want to keep

556
00:18:11,919 --> 00:18:13,760
it inside of unity

557
00:18:13,760 --> 00:18:15,760
inside of blender i said unity inside of

558
00:18:15,760 --> 00:18:18,080

559
00:18:18,080 --> 00:18:20,000
so the difference though is if you're

560
00:18:20,000 --> 00:18:21,679
going to bring that into unity i don't

561
00:18:21,679 --> 00:18:23,520
recommend using the armature method

562
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:26,720
because if you're going to use bones in

563
00:18:26,720 --> 00:18:29,440
unity it's going to be using the skinned

564
00:18:29,440 --> 00:18:30,720
mesh renderer and

565
00:18:30,720 --> 00:18:33,200
that's a quite performance intensive and

566
00:18:33,200 --> 00:18:34,160
you don't really want to waste

567
00:18:34,160 --> 00:18:35,760
performance on on that one

568
00:18:35,760 --> 00:18:37,600
to have the bones affect the different

569
00:18:37,600 --> 00:18:39,760
building parts so what i've done in our

570
00:18:39,760 --> 00:18:40,559
game is

571
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,400
that i've actually exported it as

572
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:43,919
separate objects

573
00:18:43,919 --> 00:18:46,960
into one fbx file and then i animated

574
00:18:46,960 --> 00:18:48,799
the same type of appearance here but i

575
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,039
used the unity animator instead i did

576
00:18:51,039 --> 00:18:53,039
all the animations inside of unity

577
00:18:53,039 --> 00:18:55,039
so it has a very similar type of a

578
00:18:55,039 --> 00:18:56,080
timeline with a

579
00:18:56,080 --> 00:18:58,400
dope sheet style where you can create

580
00:18:58,400 --> 00:19:00,160
keyframes and you keyframe the

581
00:19:00,160 --> 00:19:03,200
xyz position inside of unity so i

582
00:19:03,200 --> 00:19:04,080
animated them

583
00:19:04,080 --> 00:19:06,559
inside there as unity animations and i

584
00:19:06,559 --> 00:19:07,440
kept the objects

585
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:10,160
separate as we have here so i think that

586
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:10,720
one's

587
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,799
more performant and if you don't mind

588
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:15,039
animating it inside of unity i prefer

589
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,720
that method a little bit quicker video

590
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:17,600
this week isn't it

591
00:19:17,600 --> 00:19:19,919
so uh not too much bonus material but a

592
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:21,679
little see-through a little hint into

593
00:19:21,679 --> 00:19:22,720
the game development

594
00:19:22,720 --> 00:19:24,799
that we're making for line war and for

595
00:19:24,799 --> 00:19:25,840
the rts game

596
00:19:25,840 --> 00:19:27,760
and hopefully gave you a little few tips

597
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:28,960
and tricks to

598
00:19:28,960 --> 00:19:31,039
get you along the way to model your own

599
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:32,160
buildings

600
00:19:32,160 --> 00:19:35,200
so until next video take care and i'll

601
00:19:35,200 --> 00:19:36,080
see you then

602
00:19:36,080 --> 00:19:39,840
bye for now
