1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,399
we're gonna make episode 25 today folks

2
00:00:02,399 --> 00:00:03,199
uh so

3
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:05,120
a lot of uh familiar faces in the chat

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:07,120
every week really happy to see a lot of

5
00:00:07,120 --> 00:00:08,400
people joined i think we set a new

6
00:00:08,400 --> 00:00:09,280
record last week

7
00:00:09,280 --> 00:00:12,639
with 418 simultaneous viewers for the

8
00:00:12,639 --> 00:00:13,360
premiere

9
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:15,040
super excited about that so thanks a lot

10
00:00:15,040 --> 00:00:16,720
boys and girl but i have to say girls

11
00:00:16,720 --> 00:00:18,160
now we got proof now in the comments

12
00:00:18,160 --> 00:00:19,520
that there are multiple women

13
00:00:19,520 --> 00:00:22,240
or girls watching so that's great you

14
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:22,800
might

15
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,720
notice two changes well first of all

16
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,400
i've shaved that's a bonus i played

17
00:00:26,400 --> 00:00:27,920
fortnite the other day and i hadn't done

18
00:00:27,920 --> 00:00:29,039
that in about

19
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:30,400
half a year and believe it or not the

20
00:00:30,400 --> 00:00:32,238
first match i had i got a

21
00:00:32,238 --> 00:00:34,239
victory royale in solo and that's pretty

22
00:00:34,239 --> 00:00:35,440
much the first one i got

23
00:00:35,440 --> 00:00:38,000
uh because i'm not so very good not so

24
00:00:38,000 --> 00:00:38,719
very good

25
00:00:38,719 --> 00:00:41,120
i'm not very good at portland in fact

26
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,360
i'm rubbish i i love the

27
00:00:43,360 --> 00:00:45,760
old fps games like unreal tournament

28
00:00:45,760 --> 00:00:46,800
rainbow six

29
00:00:46,800 --> 00:00:48,559
but that was uh easy back in the day

30
00:00:48,559 --> 00:00:49,920
because you had like forward

31
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:52,320
backward left right to strafe and then

32
00:00:52,320 --> 00:00:53,039
you could jump

33
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,719
and then switch weapons and fire that

34
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:56,480
was it that was everything that i had to

35
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:57,280
take care of

36
00:00:57,280 --> 00:01:00,079
and with fortnite uh you've implemented

37
00:01:00,079 --> 00:01:01,520
a whole set of keys that i didn't even

38
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,280
know you could uh press at the same time

39
00:01:03,280 --> 00:01:06,479
by the way that uh just as i got that

40
00:01:06,479 --> 00:01:07,920
fortnight kill

41
00:01:07,920 --> 00:01:10,000
i got a mustache it just like that it

42
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,920
popped out you and i decided to advance

43
00:01:11,920 --> 00:01:13,200
i thought i can't be sitting here he's

44
00:01:13,200 --> 00:01:14,799
gonna knock out

45
00:01:14,799 --> 00:01:16,560
so i start advancing i've got built some

46
00:01:16,560 --> 00:01:18,479
ramps i've got no clue what i'm doing

47
00:01:18,479 --> 00:01:20,400
and uh i thought i'm just gonna charge

48
00:01:20,400 --> 00:01:22,560
here he shoots me with an rpg knocks my

49
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:23,200
ramp down

50
00:01:23,200 --> 00:01:24,799
i don't secure my ramps or anything like

51
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,640
that and i thought i'll just run to make

52
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,159
sure i get high ground i've not

53
00:01:28,159 --> 00:01:30,400
never done that before i've tried to box

54
00:01:30,400 --> 00:01:32,479
him in i boxed myself in and he boxes me

55
00:01:32,479 --> 00:01:32,880
and

56
00:01:32,880 --> 00:01:35,680
shoot my shook my way up with a with a

57
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,840
tactical shotgun and then i watch myself

58
00:01:37,840 --> 00:01:39,119
in i've got no clue

59
00:01:39,119 --> 00:01:41,840
and then he's above me and i finally

60
00:01:41,840 --> 00:01:43,360
managed to knock him out

61
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,079
with a classical shot so there you have

62
00:01:46,079 --> 00:01:47,280
it guys that's why i've got this

63
00:01:47,280 --> 00:01:49,520
mustache it just grew out after my first

64
00:01:49,520 --> 00:01:49,920
win

65
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,520
so there are two things uh you're gonna

66
00:01:51,520 --> 00:01:53,280
notice different first of all down in

67
00:01:53,280 --> 00:01:54,000
the corner here

68
00:01:54,000 --> 00:01:56,399
you'll see that it says 2.83 because

69
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:57,759
i've installed the new version and it's

70
00:01:57,759 --> 00:01:58,960
crashed a few times on me

71
00:01:58,960 --> 00:02:00,479
so this is going to be like a big gamble

72
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,240
now i'm going to do uh do some crazy

73
00:02:02,240 --> 00:02:02,880
stuff here

74
00:02:02,880 --> 00:02:06,159
check out my palette guys and girl

75
00:02:06,159 --> 00:02:08,639
loads of guys and a few girls i've got a

76
00:02:08,639 --> 00:02:09,598
gradient going

77
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,120
so i've changed it up a little bit i'm

78
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:13,520
gonna make a tree that's it

79
00:02:13,520 --> 00:02:15,280
one tree i'm not gonna do a whole forest

80
00:02:15,280 --> 00:02:17,599
i'm not gonna do a landscape i'm gonna

81
00:02:17,599 --> 00:02:18,640
do a tree

82
00:02:18,640 --> 00:02:20,319
but i'm gonna try to put a little bit

83
00:02:20,319 --> 00:02:21,520
more detail in it but it's going to be

84
00:02:21,520 --> 00:02:23,200
low quality so don't worry i'll have to

85
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,400
redeem myself from last

86
00:02:24,400 --> 00:02:26,959
week's octopus giant squid slash uh

87
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:28,000
kraken that was

88
00:02:28,000 --> 00:02:30,239
like 1.5 million polygons so i've done

89
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,000
it myself enough to last for

90
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:34,560
pretty much a lifetime so i'm going to

91
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:36,080
go low poly again and i'm gonna make a

92
00:02:36,080 --> 00:02:37,440
tree all right

93
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:41,200
focus don't touch my face

94
00:02:41,200 --> 00:02:44,239
it's corona i still haven't learned that

95
00:02:44,239 --> 00:02:47,519
by the time the vaccine comes i'm gonna

96
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:51,040
have learnt maybe to not touch my face

97
00:02:51,040 --> 00:02:54,239
ready steady go

98
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:57,040
tab into edit mode and m is the new

99
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:57,920
hotkey to merge

100
00:02:57,920 --> 00:03:02,720
at center let's just do right click

101
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:06,319
hold the ctrl key and right click

102
00:03:06,319 --> 00:03:08,720
and it will just swirl up here like in

103
00:03:08,720 --> 00:03:10,720
an s shape for the tree

104
00:03:10,720 --> 00:03:14,239
like this maybe and then

105
00:03:14,239 --> 00:03:16,000
rotate the viewport a bit let's branch

106
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:18,800
off here ctrl

107
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:21,760
and let's do another one here these are

108
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:23,200
going to be branches just that we're

109
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,120
going to make

110
00:03:25,120 --> 00:03:28,159
control to expand that

111
00:03:28,159 --> 00:03:33,840
maybe here

112
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,720
uh just holding the control key down and

113
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,319
right clicking to

114
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:41,599
get this uh the branch system up

115
00:03:41,599 --> 00:03:45,200
okay let's pick that vertex as well

116
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:48,239
and proportional rotate z twist a little

117
00:03:48,239 --> 00:03:49,920
bit here as well

118
00:03:49,920 --> 00:03:53,439
let's get this one back to the center as

119
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:55,439
well

120
00:03:55,439 --> 00:03:58,480
g okay now we're going to apply the skin

121
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,080
modifier here

122
00:04:00,080 --> 00:04:04,080
so if i could click in the right place

123
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:07,519
skin and symmetry off here and let's

124
00:04:07,519 --> 00:04:10,000
pick this vertex here ctrl a to resize

125
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:11,360
the skinning

126
00:04:11,360 --> 00:04:13,840
and then here shift g and do amount of

127
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,439
connecting edges and then deselect the

128
00:04:15,439 --> 00:04:17,120
bottom one here so we get all the tip

129
00:04:17,120 --> 00:04:18,478
ones

130
00:04:18,478 --> 00:04:21,759
and ctrl a to scale the tips down a lot

131
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:26,160
maybe like change the proportional size

132
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:28,960
okay to there and then now let's apply

133
00:04:28,960 --> 00:04:29,919
this one

134
00:04:29,919 --> 00:04:32,560
and then select this bottom face row or

135
00:04:32,560 --> 00:04:33,840
off with proportional

136
00:04:33,840 --> 00:04:37,759
rotate z rotate set zero

137
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:41,120
rotate z zero

138
00:04:41,120 --> 00:04:44,560
oh scale zero that's what i want ctrl

139
00:04:44,560 --> 00:04:46,479
r loop cut that one because we're going

140
00:04:46,479 --> 00:04:48,240
to subdivide this one now ctrl

141
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,120
one to subdivide it apply that one

142
00:04:51,120 --> 00:04:53,759
select a few phases here and do uh

143
00:04:53,759 --> 00:04:55,840
one of these little cut-off branches

144
00:04:55,840 --> 00:04:57,440
here so f3

145
00:04:57,440 --> 00:05:01,120
circle select e to extrude s to scale

146
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:04,240
e to extrude s to scale i to inset e to

147
00:05:04,240 --> 00:05:05,520
extrude in

148
00:05:05,520 --> 00:05:07,840
and let's do eight select everything

149
00:05:07,840 --> 00:05:09,520
reset the uvs here

150
00:05:09,520 --> 00:05:12,560
a scale 0 on the uv side g to move it

151
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:15,919
to there a brown tree and now we can

152
00:05:15,919 --> 00:05:17,680
select

153
00:05:17,680 --> 00:05:21,199
in there and make it brighter that's it

154
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:23,360
let's actually disable specular lighting

155
00:05:23,360 --> 00:05:25,520
for this one there

156
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,759
okay and let's do some interesting

157
00:05:27,759 --> 00:05:29,680
shapes here as well so i'll shift select

158
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:30,560
these

159
00:05:30,560 --> 00:05:33,600
e to extrude that on scale it and bring

160
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,240
it down just to get some more

161
00:05:36,240 --> 00:05:40,000
uh like definition to the tree here

162
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:41,520
i actually saw something similar in

163
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:42,560
fortnite that's where i got the

164
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:44,080
inspiration so

165
00:05:44,080 --> 00:05:45,919
but they have uh branches aren't just

166
00:05:45,919 --> 00:05:48,400
like normal solids so

167
00:05:48,400 --> 00:05:50,960
and we might as well do some roots here

168
00:05:50,960 --> 00:05:51,520
so it's

169
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:53,360
traditional e to extrude as the scale e

170
00:05:53,360 --> 00:05:55,520
to extrude as the scale

171
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:57,759
let's do here as well e to extrude as

172
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,600
the scale

173
00:05:59,600 --> 00:06:01,360
i could actually do uh control right

174
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:02,800
click here as well so control right

175
00:06:02,800 --> 00:06:03,440
click

176
00:06:03,440 --> 00:06:05,600
scale control right click but the merge

177
00:06:05,600 --> 00:06:07,039
wouldn't sound very good if it said

178
00:06:07,039 --> 00:06:07,680
control

179
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,280
right click so i'm going to do e to

180
00:06:09,280 --> 00:06:11,120
extrude as the scale g to move e to

181
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,759
extrude as the scale g to move

182
00:06:13,759 --> 00:06:15,039
okay that's it now we're going to make

183
00:06:15,039 --> 00:06:17,039
the canopy stuff here so shift

184
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,080
right click here 1.636 shift a

185
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,160
let's add a mesh and we want to do an

186
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:23,759
ico sphere

187
00:06:23,759 --> 00:06:28,560
let's bump that up to 3 tab and

188
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:31,199
let's we have to change the shading here

189
00:06:31,199 --> 00:06:33,520
and pick the same material for that one

190
00:06:33,520 --> 00:06:36,080
uv editing a select everything scale

191
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,560
zero

192
00:06:36,560 --> 00:06:39,759
make that a little bit green like that

193
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,840
and then let's do side view and pick the

194
00:06:41,840 --> 00:06:43,759
bottom vertex there

195
00:06:43,759 --> 00:06:46,560
proportional should be on g zed scroll

196
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,479
it down let's make it

197
00:06:48,479 --> 00:06:51,440
into something like that i'll scale it

198
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:51,759
up

199
00:06:51,759 --> 00:06:56,160
a lot side maybe side view

200
00:06:56,400 --> 00:07:00,319
and here and let's go to the top one

201
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:02,720
pick that one control plus a whole bunch

202
00:07:02,720 --> 00:07:04,160
to there

203
00:07:04,160 --> 00:07:06,720
three to get to edge alt e extrude long

204
00:07:06,720 --> 00:07:07,840
normals

205
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:11,039
control minus alt e extra normals let's

206
00:07:11,039 --> 00:07:11,360
get

207
00:07:11,360 --> 00:07:14,720
like a layered uh canopy here so alt e

208
00:07:14,720 --> 00:07:18,160
extra long normals alt e extrude longer

209
00:07:18,160 --> 00:07:19,440
and one more time all the

210
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:23,199
extrude one levels 553

211
00:07:23,199 --> 00:07:25,840
so now maybe we'll do select some random

212
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:27,120
here so select random

213
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,160
let's go down to 15 percent

214
00:07:30,160 --> 00:07:33,280
and then do uh alt s to scale that into

215
00:07:33,280 --> 00:07:35,280
some wonky shape here

216
00:07:35,280 --> 00:07:37,520
and we can actually even put some random

217
00:07:37,520 --> 00:07:38,560
stuff on here

218
00:07:38,560 --> 00:07:42,639
uh control plus no control minus

219
00:07:42,840 --> 00:07:45,599
scale okay that should be good

220
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:47,120
and let's twist as well with some

221
00:07:47,120 --> 00:07:48,800
proportional here so let's go back to

222
00:07:48,800 --> 00:07:49,599
smooth

223
00:07:49,599 --> 00:07:52,080
rotates is that actually before that i'm

224
00:07:52,080 --> 00:07:53,360
going to do this

225
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,440
i'm going to select all the vertices and

226
00:07:55,440 --> 00:07:57,440
then reselect the bottom one so that's

227
00:07:57,440 --> 00:07:58,240
active

228
00:07:58,240 --> 00:08:00,720
and then switch here to vertex snapping

229
00:08:00,720 --> 00:08:02,240
and we want

230
00:08:02,240 --> 00:08:04,160
active snap width active now i should be

231
00:08:04,160 --> 00:08:05,280
able to do shift

232
00:08:05,280 --> 00:08:08,960
d and then hold the ctrl key to snap it

233
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:09,919
to the tip

234
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:13,840
of these branches here

235
00:08:13,840 --> 00:08:17,759
that's it and now let's do some rotating

236
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:21,120
proportional rotation here

237
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:25,120
rotate rotate like that

238
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:30,560
and some different sizes maybe so 4 27

239
00:08:31,520 --> 00:08:34,719
scale and let's get some stuff hanging

240
00:08:34,719 --> 00:08:36,559
down as well maybe so i'll shift select

241
00:08:36,559 --> 00:08:38,399
a few

242
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,240
vertices here and we've got proportional

243
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:41,440
on

244
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:44,159
just g to move these down maybe to there

245
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:45,920
okay let's make a little uh base for

246
00:08:45,920 --> 00:08:48,720
this to stand on as well maybe

247
00:08:48,720 --> 00:08:52,560
so i'll do duplicate

248
00:08:52,560 --> 00:08:56,240
maybe that shift d scale

249
00:08:56,240 --> 00:08:59,360
scale more to there

250
00:08:59,360 --> 00:09:01,120
and p to set up create that into a

251
00:09:01,120 --> 00:09:03,040
different mesh

252
00:09:03,040 --> 00:09:06,480
no okay well let's extrude it first and

253
00:09:06,480 --> 00:09:09,760
l and now p into a new mesh

254
00:09:09,760 --> 00:09:11,440
let's make it green so l select

255
00:09:11,440 --> 00:09:13,440
everything change it to a brighter green

256
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,920
341 we've got on the clock there

257
00:09:15,920 --> 00:09:19,040
so maybe we'll do uh just

258
00:09:19,040 --> 00:09:21,279
move this down a bit g to move that one

259
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:22,640
to there

260
00:09:22,640 --> 00:09:24,480
actually let's sculpt this so let's go

261
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,080
into sculpting

262
00:09:26,080 --> 00:09:30,240
dino topo okay f to scale this one up

263
00:09:30,240 --> 00:09:32,720
and then thanks for that tip by the way

264
00:09:32,720 --> 00:09:34,080
and then

265
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,360
uh let's see we do control left click

266
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:40,880
oh we have to switch off symmetry

267
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,519
so just control and left click here to

268
00:09:43,519 --> 00:09:50,880
lower this down a little bit

269
00:09:50,880 --> 00:09:54,399
got some stuff breaking there

270
00:09:54,399 --> 00:10:04,560
maybe up a bit down a bit

271
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,600
okay uh 249. so let's tab out of that

272
00:10:07,600 --> 00:10:09,440
one go back into uv editing

273
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,920
l to select everything a on the uvs

274
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:12,880
scale 0

275
00:10:12,880 --> 00:10:16,560
bring it back to the green color

276
00:10:17,760 --> 00:10:19,680
okay for some reason i was still in

277
00:10:19,680 --> 00:10:22,079
sculpting there okay

278
00:10:22,079 --> 00:10:24,880
now we can go to the bottom view ctrl 7

279
00:10:24,880 --> 00:10:26,000
c to circle select

280
00:10:26,000 --> 00:10:28,399
let's just uh do a whole bunch of these

281
00:10:28,399 --> 00:10:30,240
here

282
00:10:30,240 --> 00:10:32,399
okay before i do that let's decimate it

283
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,360
actually we need to

284
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:37,200
bring the low poly back into low polygon

285
00:10:37,360 --> 00:10:40,640
maybe like that

286
00:10:40,800 --> 00:10:44,959
apply that one i've got 2 minutes 12.

287
00:10:44,959 --> 00:10:48,240
so let's do a nude double click a to

288
00:10:48,240 --> 00:10:49,040
deselect

289
00:10:49,040 --> 00:10:52,160
maybe circle select that

290
00:10:52,160 --> 00:10:53,600
and now we should do we've got

291
00:10:53,600 --> 00:10:57,360
proportional so let's just g

292
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:02,000
and then control minus and g to move

293
00:11:02,000 --> 00:11:03,839
that on down

294
00:11:03,839 --> 00:11:07,600
control minus g control minus

295
00:11:07,600 --> 00:11:10,959
g control minus g

296
00:11:10,959 --> 00:11:15,680
control plus a few times

297
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:20,160
here maybe let's select some of this

298
00:11:20,160 --> 00:11:22,079
i want to make some dark look here

299
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:24,160
underneath

300
00:11:24,160 --> 00:11:25,600
just to make the thumbnail pop a little

301
00:11:25,600 --> 00:11:27,040
bit more for the video this is not the

302
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:27,839
tree no

303
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:29,680
i guess the roots are there but let's go

304
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:31,600
there

305
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,800
too dark maybe there

306
00:11:34,800 --> 00:11:38,480
too dark there

307
00:11:38,480 --> 00:11:40,839
very dark okay maybe i've got too much

308
00:11:40,839 --> 00:11:44,000
shadow so

309
00:11:44,000 --> 00:11:45,760
that's it and we can decimate this one

310
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,279
we've got one minute to go so let's add

311
00:11:47,279 --> 00:11:49,279
a decimate modifier here

312
00:11:49,279 --> 00:11:51,200
bring this one down as well to get a

313
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,360
little bit more low poly again

314
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:57,519
maybe there apply that one

315
00:11:57,519 --> 00:12:00,000
did i even

316
00:12:02,560 --> 00:12:05,360
okay and let's add a little stone here

317
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,120
for good measure we've got 48 seconds to

318
00:12:07,120 --> 00:12:09,040
go so

319
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,480
there shift d to duplicate it

320
00:12:12,480 --> 00:12:15,519
e to extrude s to scale

321
00:12:15,519 --> 00:12:18,399
um got proportional there so g e to

322
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:21,600
extrude that's the scale

323
00:12:22,480 --> 00:12:24,880
and then period and let's do or actually

324
00:12:24,880 --> 00:12:25,839
comma

325
00:12:25,839 --> 00:12:29,600
normal scale z flatten that one

326
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,160
to zero control plus a few times we've

327
00:12:32,160 --> 00:12:33,279
got 22 seconds

328
00:12:33,279 --> 00:12:36,959
so now we've got a stone here and

329
00:12:36,959 --> 00:12:41,920
lasting about 16 seconds

330
00:12:43,279 --> 00:12:48,480
12 uv

331
00:12:48,480 --> 00:12:52,639
project from u scale

332
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:57,360
scale and we got the gradient going

333
00:12:57,360 --> 00:13:00,800
just in time i should change this here

334
00:13:00,800 --> 00:13:02,160
tonight

335
00:13:02,160 --> 00:13:05,440
and i miss

336
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,920
okay we've got ours i lied a little bit

337
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:09,440
because i said i was gonna make a tree

338
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,160
only and i thought i'd uh enable i'll

339
00:13:12,160 --> 00:13:13,920
add some uh some visuals so i added a

340
00:13:13,920 --> 00:13:15,120
rock and a little

341
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:16,639
sorry about that floating island i guess

342
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:19,200
it is floating island

343
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,920
and uh it's a slight gradient now to the

344
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:23,120
canopy i don't know if you can actually

345
00:13:23,120 --> 00:13:24,560
see that because i've got the

346
00:13:24,560 --> 00:13:26,639
the whole thing maybe if we disable uh

347
00:13:26,639 --> 00:13:28,079
cavity

348
00:13:28,079 --> 00:13:30,800
um it's uh brighter at the top here and

349
00:13:30,800 --> 00:13:32,160
then it goes a little bit darker at the

350
00:13:32,160 --> 00:13:33,680
bottom so maybe that's uh

351
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:35,920
useful but let's uh re-enable cavity

352
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:36,440
here

353
00:13:36,440 --> 00:13:39,649
[Music]

354
00:13:39,680 --> 00:13:41,279
there we have it we've got ourselves a

355
00:13:41,279 --> 00:13:43,120
low poly tree we're back into low poly

356
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:45,360
world literally and we're back even into

357
00:13:45,360 --> 00:13:48,399
a floating island i'm back into my

358
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,000
element now happy with that didn't get a

359
00:13:50,000 --> 00:13:51,680
waterfall but that's okay it was mainly

360
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,959
the tree that i was gonna make anyway a

361
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:54,399
low poly tree

362
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:56,720
uh so the tip for this week is gonna be

363
00:13:56,720 --> 00:13:57,839
um

364
00:13:57,839 --> 00:14:00,079
it's that method actually of the using

365
00:14:00,079 --> 00:14:00,959
the skinning

366
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,120
so i guess it's a bit stupid to repeat

367
00:14:03,120 --> 00:14:04,320
it so let's repeat it

368
00:14:04,320 --> 00:14:07,040
um what i did was um if i go over here

369
00:14:07,040 --> 00:14:09,120
shift right click to move the cursor

370
00:14:09,120 --> 00:14:11,360
tab shift a let's add the it's not the

371
00:14:11,360 --> 00:14:12,800
default cube but it's a very similar

372
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:13,760
it's a clone of it

373
00:14:13,760 --> 00:14:16,079
so that's gonna have to do so the thing

374
00:14:16,079 --> 00:14:16,880
here the

375
00:14:16,880 --> 00:14:19,199
fastest way i know is to get into a

376
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:20,160
single vertex

377
00:14:20,160 --> 00:14:22,240
and we have it theoretically we haven't

378
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:23,760
actually started from anything

379
00:14:23,760 --> 00:14:25,440
else but the default cube that's very

380
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,279
important as you all know

381
00:14:27,279 --> 00:14:28,959
so it's still the default cube that we

382
00:14:28,959 --> 00:14:31,680
used but i i selected all the vertices

383
00:14:31,680 --> 00:14:32,480
on that one

384
00:14:32,480 --> 00:14:35,680
and then the new hotkey in 2.83 is not

385
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,480
alt m the new key is m just if you want

386
00:14:38,480 --> 00:14:39,199
to merge

387
00:14:39,199 --> 00:14:41,120
and then at center i did just to get

388
00:14:41,120 --> 00:14:43,199
that little vertex there

389
00:14:43,199 --> 00:14:45,360
and then you could do e to extrude e to

390
00:14:45,360 --> 00:14:47,120
extrude e to extrude e to extrude e to

391
00:14:47,120 --> 00:14:48,959
extrude e to extrude e to extrude e to

392
00:14:48,959 --> 00:14:49,839
extrude

393
00:14:49,839 --> 00:14:51,279
and that would be the right way to do it

394
00:14:51,279 --> 00:14:53,120
but i cheated a little bit so i

395
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:53,920
controlled

396
00:14:53,920 --> 00:14:57,360
right clicked to get it

397
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:59,279
i think and the other key is see that

398
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,720
it's really created everything on

399
00:15:00,720 --> 00:15:03,839
on like a flat uh flat plane there so i

400
00:15:03,839 --> 00:15:04,560
recommend that

401
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,959
you rotate the viewport a little bit

402
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,399
when you click

403
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:09,920
and that will make it go a little bit in

404
00:15:09,920 --> 00:15:12,000
different shapes and to branch it all

405
00:15:12,000 --> 00:15:13,040
you need to do is select

406
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:15,760
a vertex down where you were ctrl right

407
00:15:15,760 --> 00:15:16,480
click

408
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:18,720
to branch it again another one ctrl

409
00:15:18,720 --> 00:15:20,880
right click to branch that one

410
00:15:20,880 --> 00:15:24,399
ctrl right click and then when you had

411
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,079
the shape that you wanted here and then

412
00:15:26,079 --> 00:15:27,920
we added the modifier and it's the skin

413
00:15:27,920 --> 00:15:29,440
modifier

414
00:15:29,440 --> 00:15:31,120
and we have to disable symmetry because

415
00:15:31,120 --> 00:15:32,720
we don't want symmetry

416
00:15:32,720 --> 00:15:34,639
even though i love symmetry my mind

417
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:36,880
loves symmetry

418
00:15:36,880 --> 00:15:39,279
in fact i love drawing when i work in my

419
00:15:39,279 --> 00:15:40,399
day job as a

420
00:15:40,399 --> 00:15:42,800
security architect i love drawing

421
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:44,560
redundant solutions because then i can

422
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:44,959
have

423
00:15:44,959 --> 00:15:47,199
two trees that look nearly identical

424
00:15:47,199 --> 00:15:48,560
well they look identical i make sure

425
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:50,240
they do

426
00:15:50,240 --> 00:15:52,480
so redundancy is good for many reasons

427
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,600
most important

428
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,800
for my ocd needs that's why import that

429
00:15:56,800 --> 00:15:58,160
synchronous what was i even talking

430
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:58,639
about

431
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:02,240
okay when i had the skinning there here

432
00:16:02,240 --> 00:16:05,279
i applied it and then in order to i

433
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:05,759
didn't

434
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,000
i lied i didn't apply it tab into edit

435
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:09,600
mode and then i selected the

436
00:16:09,600 --> 00:16:11,360
bottom vertex here because it's still

437
00:16:11,360 --> 00:16:13,040
just uh skinning basic

438
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,360
basically makes it thick the the edges

439
00:16:15,360 --> 00:16:16,480
that we had

440
00:16:16,480 --> 00:16:18,480
so and you can't press s to scale you

441
00:16:18,480 --> 00:16:19,759
can't scale a vertex

442
00:16:19,759 --> 00:16:22,240
but ctrl a you can do and that's

443
00:16:22,240 --> 00:16:24,079
basically the same thing

444
00:16:24,079 --> 00:16:25,519
and then do that with proportional

445
00:16:25,519 --> 00:16:27,279
editing you could click o to toggle that

446
00:16:27,279 --> 00:16:28,079
on

447
00:16:28,079 --> 00:16:30,320
and then with the ctrl a you could do

448
00:16:30,320 --> 00:16:33,120
the base here and make it a lot thicker

449
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:35,120
and then i selected the tip here and

450
00:16:35,120 --> 00:16:36,160
then i did shift

451
00:16:36,160 --> 00:16:38,560
g thanks to those of you who suggested

452
00:16:38,560 --> 00:16:39,199
to uh

453
00:16:39,199 --> 00:16:40,880
to use shift g shortcut instead of

454
00:16:40,880 --> 00:16:43,440
pressing f3 and then i did the amount of

455
00:16:43,440 --> 00:16:44,959
connecting edges because

456
00:16:44,959 --> 00:16:46,720
amount of connecting edges to this

457
00:16:46,720 --> 00:16:48,560
vertex here is one

458
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,480
and the the vertices that are in here

459
00:16:50,480 --> 00:16:52,399
have two connecting edges so that's uh

460
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,399
one of the faster ways to select

461
00:16:54,399 --> 00:16:57,279
uh all the end points but then i had to

462
00:16:57,279 --> 00:16:58,880
deselect this one so i shift

463
00:16:58,880 --> 00:17:01,199
clicked on that one and then did control

464
00:17:01,199 --> 00:17:02,560
a to rescale

465
00:17:02,560 --> 00:17:03,759
these branches and you can have

466
00:17:03,759 --> 00:17:05,439
proportional here to make it in

467
00:17:05,439 --> 00:17:06,079
different

468
00:17:06,079 --> 00:17:11,839
thicknesses okay and then i pressed ctrl

469
00:17:11,839 --> 00:17:14,640
one oh no first i applied it and then

470
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,199
pressed ctrl 1 to subdivide it

471
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:19,359
okay and if you don't want this round

472
00:17:19,359 --> 00:17:20,959
thing here at the bottom by the way

473
00:17:20,959 --> 00:17:22,959
so when i press ctrl 1 to subdivide see

474
00:17:22,959 --> 00:17:24,720
that it becomes like a droplet

475
00:17:24,720 --> 00:17:26,880
here if you don't want that to happen

476
00:17:26,880 --> 00:17:27,839
you can do

477
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,160
what i did here as well ctrl r for loop

478
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,280
cut and then make

479
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:33,919
that edge right at the base there

480
00:17:33,919 --> 00:17:35,440
because then suddenly it's two edges

481
00:17:35,440 --> 00:17:37,200
here for it to subdivide with and that

482
00:17:37,200 --> 00:17:39,280
makes it sharper so when i press ctrl 1

483
00:17:39,280 --> 00:17:39,760
now

484
00:17:39,760 --> 00:17:42,160
you can see that it keeps a sharp edge

485
00:17:42,160 --> 00:17:43,679
down here okay and then i

486
00:17:43,679 --> 00:17:45,360
applied that one that's one way you

487
00:17:45,360 --> 00:17:47,120
could do to create the interesting trees

488
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:48,000
uh one more tip

489
00:17:48,000 --> 00:17:49,840
actually i'm gonna throw you some extra

490
00:17:49,840 --> 00:17:52,320
bonuses here i selected these four faces

491
00:17:52,320 --> 00:17:54,240
or not them i selected them one over

492
00:17:54,240 --> 00:17:56,240
there and then if you go into

493
00:17:56,240 --> 00:17:57,600
preferences here

494
00:17:57,600 --> 00:18:00,799
there's actually an add-on called loop

495
00:18:00,799 --> 00:18:01,600
tools

496
00:18:01,600 --> 00:18:04,160
and that comes with unity by unity when

497
00:18:04,160 --> 00:18:04,640
i plan

498
00:18:04,640 --> 00:18:06,720
on my own it comes with blender by

499
00:18:06,720 --> 00:18:08,080
default but you have to enable it

500
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:10,720
so you just click this little box there

501
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,520
because when you

502
00:18:11,520 --> 00:18:13,679
press f3 now or there's a menu for it

503
00:18:13,679 --> 00:18:16,080
somewhere i think as well

504
00:18:16,080 --> 00:18:19,120
but if you press f3 and type circle and

505
00:18:19,120 --> 00:18:20,880
that's one of the tools that it's got

506
00:18:20,880 --> 00:18:23,360
and that basically turns those faces

507
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,799
that i had which were more or less

508
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,160
square into a circle

509
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,799
how to turn a square into a circle e to

510
00:18:28,799 --> 00:18:30,160
extrude s

511
00:18:30,160 --> 00:18:32,880
okay proportional so o to disable that

512
00:18:32,880 --> 00:18:33,840
and s to scale

513
00:18:33,840 --> 00:18:36,000
and for the canopy i guess uh it's a bit

514
00:18:36,000 --> 00:18:37,360
similar to what i've done before a lot

515
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:39,280
of proportional editing stuff so nothing

516
00:18:39,280 --> 00:18:40,000
magic there

517
00:18:40,000 --> 00:18:42,160
did some basic sculpting for this one we

518
00:18:42,160 --> 00:18:43,760
did that in the octopus one

519
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,039
so do you know what i'm going to cut

520
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:46,400
this video a little bit shorter because

521
00:18:46,400 --> 00:18:48,160
i keep talking for too long and i make

522
00:18:48,160 --> 00:18:49,280
my 10 minute videos

523
00:18:49,280 --> 00:18:50,880
30 minutes and that's no good and then

524
00:18:50,880 --> 00:18:52,080
i'm going to extend the video anyway

525
00:18:52,080 --> 00:18:52,400
because

526
00:18:52,400 --> 00:18:53,840
do you know what let's try to put this

527
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:56,000
tree i'm working on something so

528
00:18:56,000 --> 00:18:58,160
scrap what i just said and let's do

529
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:00,080
something here so let's select that one

530
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,320
that one the floating island can stay

531
00:19:02,320 --> 00:19:03,120
here

532
00:19:03,120 --> 00:19:06,400
but let's go export and export it as an

533
00:19:06,400 --> 00:19:07,679
fbx file

534
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:11,200
selected objects apply transform and

535
00:19:11,200 --> 00:19:12,320
apply scaling

536
00:19:12,320 --> 00:19:15,039
unit scale here and now i'm going to go

537
00:19:15,039 --> 00:19:16,720
into a secret project i'm

538
00:19:16,720 --> 00:19:18,960
filming another video i keep filming a

539
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:20,480
lot of videos that i haven't released so

540
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,400
i have to release it for you because i'm

541
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,760
just doing a week

542
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:25,679
weekly video now and if i want to reach

543
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:27,760
200k or 100k

544
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,600
i don't think i can do weekly videos i

545
00:19:29,600 --> 00:19:31,200
have to do at least two a week

546
00:19:31,200 --> 00:19:34,559
so but let's go into poly plays one hdrp

547
00:19:34,559 --> 00:19:36,000
because i'm learning the high render

548
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:38,640
high definition

549
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,080
i'm learning the high definition render

550
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:43,600
pipeline in unity 2019.3 so let's go

551
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:45,280
into assets let's save

552
00:19:45,280 --> 00:19:47,360
this tree here the 10-minute tree and

553
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,520
now my friends i'm going to bridge this

554
00:19:49,520 --> 00:19:50,000
world

555
00:19:50,000 --> 00:19:53,360
of blender into unity so let's minimize

556
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:53,919
that

557
00:19:53,919 --> 00:19:56,160
so i've had some requests to do

558
00:19:56,160 --> 00:19:57,520
something that i spent more than 10

559
00:19:57,520 --> 00:19:58,240
minutes on

560
00:19:58,240 --> 00:20:01,120
so i've spent about uh maybe uh an hour

561
00:20:01,120 --> 00:20:02,159
and a half two hours

562
00:20:02,159 --> 00:20:04,559
on creating a more detailed island here

563
00:20:04,559 --> 00:20:06,320
um in unity

564
00:20:06,320 --> 00:20:08,559
so um and i feel i'm filming that one as

565
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,159
well i'm just a little bit more casual

566
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,440
about it i'm like modeling

567
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,919
chatting away digressing on some useless

568
00:20:13,919 --> 00:20:15,679
information that probably no one will

569
00:20:15,679 --> 00:20:17,039
want to listen to

570
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:18,720
but then every now and then i managed to

571
00:20:18,720 --> 00:20:20,559
throw in some sort of a comment that

572
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:22,559
might be useful for someone so maybe

573
00:20:22,559 --> 00:20:24,159
people can take it away i found actually

574
00:20:24,159 --> 00:20:25,760
when i modeled this i found a new trick

575
00:20:25,760 --> 00:20:27,120
in blender that i'm going to share in

576
00:20:27,120 --> 00:20:28,880
this video so come back for that one

577
00:20:28,880 --> 00:20:30,720
subscribe if you haven't already if you

578
00:20:30,720 --> 00:20:32,559
want to see that one this is uh like a

579
00:20:32,559 --> 00:20:32,960
skull

580
00:20:32,960 --> 00:20:35,360
island maybe i'll do uh well you know uh

581
00:20:35,360 --> 00:20:36,960
with a pirate theme i guess you've seen

582
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:38,240
i've seen it all

583
00:20:38,240 --> 00:20:40,320
so i've got the pirate ship i've got uh

584
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:41,679
the pirate i've got the kraken and

585
00:20:41,679 --> 00:20:42,799
everything so maybe

586
00:20:42,799 --> 00:20:45,600
this will might turn into something like

587
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:46,880
a pirate island

588
00:20:46,880 --> 00:20:47,919
then i worked a little bit on this

589
00:20:47,919 --> 00:20:49,120
shader as well i got a little bit

590
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,400
inspired from

591
00:20:50,400 --> 00:20:52,320
there's a game called the bad north with

592
00:20:52,320 --> 00:20:53,440
a guy oscar

593
00:20:53,440 --> 00:20:54,960
something on twitter you should look it

594
00:20:54,960 --> 00:20:56,400
up he's got some really cool stuff and i

595
00:20:56,400 --> 00:20:57,200
got a little bit

596
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,919
inspired by that look uh to get a shader

597
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,520
just to do some ripples

598
00:21:01,520 --> 00:21:03,840
i think his is better i'm just basically

599
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:05,360
throwing something together in

600
00:21:05,360 --> 00:21:07,360
what's called shader graph with a high

601
00:21:07,360 --> 00:21:09,280
definition render pipeline here

602
00:21:09,280 --> 00:21:10,880
but i've got some transparency in the

603
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,320
water and i've got some ripples here

604
00:21:12,320 --> 00:21:12,960
around there

605
00:21:12,960 --> 00:21:15,039
and i've got some lighting effects going

606
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,720
on and if you press play actually it

607
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:17,200
looks

608
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
even a little bit better than it does

609
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:20,320
here in the editor

610
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,159
so i can move around this little world

611
00:21:22,159 --> 00:21:23,440
here i'm not going to show you too much

612
00:21:23,440 --> 00:21:24,480
in this one because

613
00:21:24,480 --> 00:21:26,080
but let's bring the tree in that's what

614
00:21:26,080 --> 00:21:28,640
i wanted to try so i imported it or i

615
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,159
threw it into this folder so it should

616
00:21:30,159 --> 00:21:31,919
show up here i've got a lot of junk

617
00:21:31,919 --> 00:21:33,919
um that i've been testing here so 10

618
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:35,360
minute tree here we go and it's going to

619
00:21:35,360 --> 00:21:36,080
probably be

620
00:21:36,080 --> 00:21:39,600
massive because i did it really massive

621
00:21:39,600 --> 00:21:42,559
so let's scale it down r to scale have

622
00:21:42,559 --> 00:21:43,200
you heard

623
00:21:43,200 --> 00:21:45,679
something so ridiculous in unity or to

624
00:21:45,679 --> 00:21:47,039
scale imagine one day

625
00:21:47,039 --> 00:21:49,919
they'll unite the use of the hotkeys

626
00:21:49,919 --> 00:21:50,480
that would be

627
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:53,440
strange but good so let's put our tree

628
00:21:53,440 --> 00:21:55,600
that we just created in this world

629
00:21:55,600 --> 00:21:57,760
our 10 minute tree still too big maybe

630
00:21:57,760 --> 00:21:58,960
that's no good place for it

631
00:21:58,960 --> 00:22:00,880
maybe we'll move it here instead let's

632
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:03,440
press play

633
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,280
got some rocks underwater here

634
00:22:07,600 --> 00:22:09,280
here's our new tree that we just created

635
00:22:09,280 --> 00:22:13,200
wow let's go under it

636
00:22:13,200 --> 00:22:16,400
oh we've got some volumetrics here or

637
00:22:16,400 --> 00:22:16,880
it's

638
00:22:16,880 --> 00:22:20,000
oh yeah let's boost the volumetric i'm

639
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:22,159
basically just learning htrp now

640
00:22:22,159 --> 00:22:24,159
it's been in preview for about i think

641
00:22:24,159 --> 00:22:25,760
600 years

642
00:22:25,760 --> 00:22:27,600
and that's a record that's the fastest

643
00:22:27,600 --> 00:22:29,039
they've ever brought something out of

644
00:22:29,039 --> 00:22:29,520
preview

645
00:22:29,520 --> 00:22:32,320
let's go i i'm so lost here but there is

646
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,320
something here maybe it's a directional

647
00:22:34,320 --> 00:22:34,799
light

648
00:22:34,799 --> 00:22:37,039
no volumetrics multiplier here we go

649
00:22:37,039 --> 00:22:38,799
five

650
00:22:38,799 --> 00:22:40,960
let's boost the volumetrics thought i

651
00:22:40,960 --> 00:22:44,320
saw some rays here from the tree

652
00:22:44,320 --> 00:22:47,360
yeah some volumetrics here it's not so

653
00:22:47,360 --> 00:22:49,200
prominent but

654
00:22:49,200 --> 00:22:52,559
maybe i have to have dancer fog

655
00:22:54,720 --> 00:22:56,320
when you've got stuff to play with like

656
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,400
yeah you you throw all the effects on

657
00:22:58,400 --> 00:22:59,760
there and it just becomes like a big

658
00:22:59,760 --> 00:23:00,720
soup of uh

659
00:23:00,720 --> 00:23:03,039
way too overdone maybe it's better to

660
00:23:03,039 --> 00:23:04,720
take a step back sometime and just

661
00:23:04,720 --> 00:23:05,840
reduce the stuff

662
00:23:05,840 --> 00:23:08,799
this is too much fog i guess uh but

663
00:23:08,799 --> 00:23:10,240
maybe on a misty day maybe i should make

664
00:23:10,240 --> 00:23:11,520
a little adventure game i'm gonna have

665
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:13,120
some waterfalls and stuff over here as

666
00:23:13,120 --> 00:23:14,240
well and i'm gonna

667
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:15,760
bring a lot more detail here and put

668
00:23:15,760 --> 00:23:17,440
some maybe some houses on here and

669
00:23:17,440 --> 00:23:20,400
uh maybe a lighthouse and a windmill but

670
00:23:20,400 --> 00:23:20,799
again

671
00:23:20,799 --> 00:23:22,480
i'll record this into a longer video and

672
00:23:22,480 --> 00:23:23,840
if you want to tag along and watch that

673
00:23:23,840 --> 00:23:24,960
one

674
00:23:24,960 --> 00:23:27,039
you're very welcome to do so should we

675
00:23:27,039 --> 00:23:28,880
bring the whole thing in as well

676
00:23:28,880 --> 00:23:30,799
should we should we just see what that

677
00:23:30,799 --> 00:23:32,159
would look like

678
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,240
okay guys there we have it that's our 10

679
00:23:34,240 --> 00:23:36,159
minutes tree with a little bonus

680
00:23:36,159 --> 00:23:37,120
floating island

681
00:23:37,120 --> 00:23:39,679
on top of a non-floating island all

682
00:23:39,679 --> 00:23:40,799
right folks that's going to be it for

683
00:23:40,799 --> 00:23:42,240
