1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,120
today i'm going to teach you how to make

2
00:00:01,120 --> 00:00:02,879
a low poly landscape inside blender

3
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:05,120
let's go okay so here we are over in

4
00:00:05,120 --> 00:00:06,480
london basically what you want to do

5
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,480
first is you can have your basic

6
00:00:08,480 --> 00:00:10,559
landscape usually what you do so i have

7
00:00:10,559 --> 00:00:11,759
like two methods for making our

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,920
landscape so the first one is you'll

9
00:00:13,920 --> 00:00:16,000
just grab like a plane we can scale it

10
00:00:16,000 --> 00:00:18,400
like all the way up like this and then

11
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,640
go ctrl a also you see so i have our

12
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:23,359
scale right a random scale so you see 86

13
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:24,880
so it's ctrl a

14
00:00:24,880 --> 00:00:27,439
scale and you see now system back to one

15
00:00:27,439 --> 00:00:30,720
and the two ways that i can do is either

16
00:00:30,720 --> 00:00:32,640
i can take this i can subdivide it so

17
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,480
i'm just going to tab to go to edit mode

18
00:00:34,480 --> 00:00:35,840
and i go to w

19
00:00:35,840 --> 00:00:38,160
subdivide and you can see it subdivided

20
00:00:38,160 --> 00:00:39,920
open up this bottom middle tab and then

21
00:00:39,920 --> 00:00:43,840
just make it like 20 or 220 uh or even

22
00:00:43,840 --> 00:00:45,280
more let's go like 40. so we have it

23
00:00:45,280 --> 00:00:47,360
like this now what we can do is we can

24
00:00:47,360 --> 00:00:49,840
use the uh proportional editing let's

25
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,120
click on this little button let me turn

26
00:00:51,120 --> 00:00:53,039
it on and what you can do with this is

27
00:00:53,039 --> 00:00:54,559
you can just select part of the part of

28
00:00:54,559 --> 00:00:56,480
it and you can see like drag it up and

29
00:00:56,480 --> 00:00:58,000
then you just scroll down your mouse

30
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,440
wheel and you can see you can kind of

31
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,600
just make changes to the whole

32
00:01:01,600 --> 00:01:03,359
kind of like landscape of it

33
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:04,799
so you can kind of usually just make

34
00:01:04,799 --> 00:01:07,200
something that you want like this

35
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:10,400
so yeah so it doesn't work too well

36
00:01:10,400 --> 00:01:12,479
you can also like sculpt it

37
00:01:12,479 --> 00:01:14,320
until you get something not don't you

38
00:01:14,320 --> 00:01:15,920
remove it too much

39
00:01:15,920 --> 00:01:17,759
and yep and you can have it like that

40
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,600
and then usually you can just like

41
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,759
select the outside edge

42
00:01:21,759 --> 00:01:24,240
and like extrude it out and i don't have

43
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:26,720
a proportionality and scale it up

44
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:29,040
and you could like add some air tubes

45
00:01:29,040 --> 00:01:31,600
and like smooth it out like that so you

46
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:33,520
get some sort of land like this

47
00:01:33,520 --> 00:01:35,680
and what you can do so you can have like

48
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:38,479
your main landscape be like around here

49
00:01:38,479 --> 00:01:40,079
and then you'll usually have like some

50
00:01:40,079 --> 00:01:42,720
sort of barriers around the edges and

51
00:01:42,720 --> 00:01:44,720
what you can do also is you can make

52
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,880
like mountains and stuff so what i'd

53
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,640
usually do with this is i'll add a

54
00:01:48,640 --> 00:01:50,880
decimate uh just to make it like look

55
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,680
more

56
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,840
nice

57
00:01:53,840 --> 00:01:56,000
and then like depending on what you

58
00:01:56,000 --> 00:01:57,920
specifically need so if you have like

59
00:01:57,920 --> 00:02:00,399
small detailed spots you can have like a

60
00:02:00,399 --> 00:02:02,159
high resolution and then like sculpt it

61
00:02:02,159 --> 00:02:02,960
in

62
00:02:02,960 --> 00:02:04,880
so you can have like some specific spots

63
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:06,880
maybe have like a river you can just go

64
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,038
sculpt mode and then just like carve

65
00:02:09,038 --> 00:02:11,760
something out for like a river

66
00:02:11,760 --> 00:02:13,840
maybe it like separates into like a pond

67
00:02:13,840 --> 00:02:15,599
and carries on out the other side so you

68
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:17,040
can see so you can kind of just quickly

69
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:19,520
sculpt it and get something simple uh

70
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:21,200
yeah like this so you can leave the the

71
00:02:21,200 --> 00:02:22,800
modifiers on as well if you want also

72
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,160
what you want to do is you want to maybe

73
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:27,760
exclusives there what you can do is you

74
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:29,680
can create like mountains so make sure

75
00:02:29,680 --> 00:02:32,000
you go to edit preferences and then go

76
00:02:32,000 --> 00:02:35,680
to add-ons a dot n so you see a dot n

77
00:02:35,680 --> 00:02:37,840
dot t and you can see and landscape so

78
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,319
just enable arts and then you'll see you

79
00:02:40,319 --> 00:02:41,599
have a create button or you can just go

80
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,959
shift a

81
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:45,120
mesh landscape and you can see it's all

82
00:02:45,120 --> 00:02:46,400
the way down here in the middle so you

83
00:02:46,400 --> 00:02:47,599
can see you can create monitors like

84
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,280
this so if you have something nice you

85
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:51,599
can just go decimate it and then just

86
00:02:51,599 --> 00:02:53,519
shades flat and then just scale it all

87
00:02:53,519 --> 00:02:55,040
the way up you can just like put it

88
00:02:55,040 --> 00:02:57,440
underneath like this uh and then you can

89
00:02:57,440 --> 00:02:59,040
just like mess around with it until it

90
00:02:59,040 --> 00:03:01,200
like intersects properly or you can use

91
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,599
something like booleans billions so yeah

92
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,200
so you can create like map uh some stuff

93
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,360
like this uh or you could you can create

94
00:03:07,360 --> 00:03:09,440
like custom mountain for each one this

95
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:11,200
river is probably a bit too big

96
00:03:11,200 --> 00:03:12,800
especially around like a mountain here

97
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,640
but yeah so we have some like this so

98
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,239
you can carry on just like working on

99
00:03:16,239 --> 00:03:17,360
something like this just to get

100
00:03:17,360 --> 00:03:19,760
something pretty decent for your thing

101
00:03:19,760 --> 00:03:21,280
uh make a custom

102
00:03:21,280 --> 00:03:24,080
uh mountain for each part and then yeah

103
00:03:24,080 --> 00:03:25,040
like this

104
00:03:25,040 --> 00:03:26,480
and then you can also set up like some

105
00:03:26,480 --> 00:03:28,480
materials let's say here we have our

106
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:31,760
camera here let's go at a camera i'm

107
00:03:31,760 --> 00:03:33,360
going to use my custom keyboard you're

108
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:35,040
going to use control

109
00:03:35,040 --> 00:03:38,400
uh control alt and 0 on the numpad

110
00:03:38,400 --> 00:03:41,840
so i'll put it like here

111
00:03:42,400 --> 00:03:43,920
you can just like sculpt the mountains

112
00:03:43,920 --> 00:03:46,560
if you want to like have it a specific

113
00:03:46,560 --> 00:03:49,360
way or like decimator more or less and

114
00:03:49,360 --> 00:03:51,440
then you want to get lucky materials

115
00:03:51,440 --> 00:03:54,640
like the mountains will be gray and then

116
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,959
you can have like your ground

117
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:58,879
be like a green

118
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,640
just go rendered i'll turn it to cycles

119
00:04:02,640 --> 00:04:04,480
i'll just set it to like a low sample

120
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,879
count and then turn on render region i

121
00:04:06,879 --> 00:04:08,720
think what i want is like a low f of e

122
00:04:08,720 --> 00:04:10,560
so i'll do like 24

123
00:04:10,560 --> 00:04:12,720
go 30 35

124
00:04:12,720 --> 00:04:14,640
so it doesn't look the greatest

125
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,320
uh it doesn't look the greatest with

126
00:04:16,320 --> 00:04:17,839
having this like little

127
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:20,000
like separation here

128
00:04:20,000 --> 00:04:21,918
uh so usually

129
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,080
so they couldn't usually just like

130
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,600
figure out a way or we can add some like

131
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:26,880
bushes and stuff

132
00:04:26,880 --> 00:04:29,840
so what you can do also we want to do

133
00:04:29,840 --> 00:04:31,840
the water so you can just go add like a

134
00:04:31,840 --> 00:04:32,800
plane

135
00:04:32,800 --> 00:04:35,680
scale it up like this

136
00:04:35,680 --> 00:04:38,800
and then just like extrude it out

137
00:04:38,800 --> 00:04:40,080
and then you'll just want to drag it up

138
00:04:40,080 --> 00:04:41,440
so you can actually see the parts

139
00:04:41,440 --> 00:04:44,320
through and then maybe just go back and

140
00:04:44,320 --> 00:04:47,040
skip parts and yeah

141
00:04:47,040 --> 00:04:48,240
there

142
00:04:48,240 --> 00:04:51,199
and then just screw it all the way along

143
00:04:51,199 --> 00:04:53,919
and then if you want to get some better

144
00:04:53,919 --> 00:04:57,280
looking like colors on the actual

145
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,479
um

146
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:00,560
also on the actual ground

147
00:05:00,560 --> 00:05:02,560
what we can do is we can do a vertex

148
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:04,479
color uh paint

149
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:05,600
and

150
00:05:05,600 --> 00:05:08,560
what that will do is if we go

151
00:05:08,560 --> 00:05:09,440
there

152
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,120
i think i want to

153
00:05:11,120 --> 00:05:14,000
fix this so we can see the water

154
00:05:14,000 --> 00:05:15,600
so maybe we can just select everything

155
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,800
and kind of like

156
00:05:16,800 --> 00:05:18,960
rotate it like this

157
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,479
and then we can just

158
00:05:20,479 --> 00:05:22,560
bring this down

159
00:05:22,560 --> 00:05:24,800
uh maybe wait

160
00:05:24,800 --> 00:05:28,000
scope mode

161
00:05:30,080 --> 00:05:32,240
it's like there okay cool

162
00:05:32,240 --> 00:05:35,120
and then what you want to do

163
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,199
is we go to

164
00:05:37,199 --> 00:05:39,600
materials give us a blue

165
00:05:39,600 --> 00:05:42,160
you're going to select subdivide this

166
00:05:42,160 --> 00:05:44,560
uh add a

167
00:05:44,560 --> 00:05:46,160
displace

168
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,039
new

169
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:50,000
go to the texture tab changes to clouds

170
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,280
you want to make it small so it's kind

171
00:05:51,280 --> 00:05:54,240
of just a random drag upstream slightly

172
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:56,479
maybe yes so the subdivisions and then

173
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:58,639
also decimate it again just to add a

174
00:05:58,639 --> 00:06:02,080
nice look to the water um but let's just

175
00:06:02,080 --> 00:06:04,479
actually just leave us an e for now you

176
00:06:04,479 --> 00:06:07,120
can also like drag down the roughness

177
00:06:07,120 --> 00:06:08,160
and maybe

178
00:06:08,160 --> 00:06:10,160
transmission so with that you'll have to

179
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:12,319
add some alpha blend that's not great

180
00:06:12,319 --> 00:06:14,160
just because of some internal preview

181
00:06:14,160 --> 00:06:16,000
and yeah so you can just mess around

182
00:06:16,000 --> 00:06:17,440
with everything and then what i'm saying

183
00:06:17,440 --> 00:06:19,919
with them at the vertex page so

184
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:23,039
basically what we can do is we can go to

185
00:06:23,039 --> 00:06:25,120
this little toolbox and black paints the

186
00:06:25,120 --> 00:06:26,400
colors on

187
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,400
so

188
00:06:28,400 --> 00:06:29,759
start this

189
00:06:29,759 --> 00:06:31,440
we'll see wait what is the color let's

190
00:06:31,440 --> 00:06:34,080
grab this color

191
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:37,199
and then paste it in

192
00:06:37,520 --> 00:06:39,360
and we can paint our entire model with

193
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,720
it

194
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:44,240
because then what we can do is go

195
00:06:44,240 --> 00:06:47,759
grab the color for the rocks

196
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:50,720
and then go away vertex paint go back to

197
00:06:50,720 --> 00:06:52,400
the tool

198
00:06:52,400 --> 00:06:56,400
and paint in the gray

199
00:07:00,319 --> 00:07:01,520
vertical screen

200
00:07:01,520 --> 00:07:03,120
so we're gonna make a color palette just

201
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,520
click new go plus

202
00:07:05,520 --> 00:07:07,360
and then put in the gray color for the

203
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,240
rocks

204
00:07:08,240 --> 00:07:10,720
click plus so we can make it there

205
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:13,720
and

206
00:07:16,240 --> 00:07:18,240
you can like paint in the colors you can

207
00:07:18,240 --> 00:07:19,599
drag it down the opacity if you want to

208
00:07:19,599 --> 00:07:21,599
like blend it in so you can kind of just

209
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:23,520
start like blending everything in

210
00:07:23,520 --> 00:07:24,880
so let's just get rid of the mountains

211
00:07:24,880 --> 00:07:26,240
for now just to

212
00:07:26,240 --> 00:07:29,039
make it easier to paint everything in

213
00:07:29,039 --> 00:07:32,000
yeah like there so if we go unhard

214
00:07:32,000 --> 00:07:35,199
if we go to shading and then we go

215
00:07:35,199 --> 00:07:37,120
vertex color

216
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,520
and then choose the color

217
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,680
color to base color and you can see so

218
00:07:41,680 --> 00:07:43,440
it actually works so you can do the same

219
00:07:43,440 --> 00:07:44,639
thing with the mountains if you want to

220
00:07:44,639 --> 00:07:46,720
paint a specific part onto them

221
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,080
and you can get it kind of working like

222
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:51,840
that if you want you can go at a

223
00:07:51,840 --> 00:07:53,840
color ramp

224
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:55,360
uh

225
00:07:55,360 --> 00:07:56,560
i don't know how well this is going to

226
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:59,199
work but we can do something like this

227
00:07:59,199 --> 00:08:00,639
and then

228
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,960
this won't really work out well

229
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:05,199
uh

230
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:07,919
okay if you can come up with a way if

231
00:08:07,919 --> 00:08:09,280
you just have like two colors whatever

232
00:08:09,280 --> 00:08:10,960
your landscape

233
00:08:10,960 --> 00:08:12,879
or you can if you have like black and

234
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:14,560
white whatever so we can set up a color

235
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:17,039
ramp like this and you can see we have

236
00:08:17,039 --> 00:08:18,240
it like this and then we can actually

237
00:08:18,240 --> 00:08:20,080
like clamp them together or just turn it

238
00:08:20,080 --> 00:08:21,759
to constant actually

239
00:08:21,759 --> 00:08:23,440
and then you can see we can kind of set

240
00:08:23,440 --> 00:08:25,120
it up this and if we have multiple

241
00:08:25,120 --> 00:08:28,240
colors um so we can have like a second

242
00:08:28,240 --> 00:08:29,360
color maybe we have like a different

243
00:08:29,360 --> 00:08:31,599
green like a darker green

244
00:08:31,599 --> 00:08:34,000
or if we have like a yellow sandy color

245
00:08:34,000 --> 00:08:35,039
kind of thing

246
00:08:35,039 --> 00:08:36,880
um we can go

247
00:08:36,880 --> 00:08:38,159
paint that in

248
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,039
like this around the sides yeah it's

249
00:08:41,039 --> 00:08:42,880
like this then you can see we can kind

250
00:08:42,880 --> 00:08:44,640
of bring it back in here

251
00:08:44,640 --> 00:08:46,080
but then what we do

252
00:08:46,080 --> 00:08:48,160
is if we bring three colors

253
00:08:48,160 --> 00:08:50,000
it'll work the best but

254
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,600
you can just get it to like set up like

255
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:52,720
this

256
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,640
and then give it the colors so we have

257
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:56,080
our base color green

258
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:57,519
check the color palette we can put

259
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,640
around gray

260
00:08:58,640 --> 00:09:00,480
or you can just have it like smooth over

261
00:09:00,480 --> 00:09:02,320
and then just plug it in and then you

262
00:09:02,320 --> 00:09:03,360
have the colors actually working

263
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,959
properly and you can change it on the

264
00:09:04,959 --> 00:09:07,200
flower like this um and i guess if you

265
00:09:07,200 --> 00:09:08,800
want you could i guess if we have a

266
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,640
darker green it might work so just grab

267
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:12,240
this color and then we can just kind of

268
00:09:12,240 --> 00:09:14,000
give it like a variation of it and then

269
00:09:14,000 --> 00:09:19,279
we can also start making some foliage
