00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,560
hello everyone and welcome to episode 71

2
00:00:02,560 --> 00:00:04,960
of the 10 minute modeling challenge

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:06,480
this time around i'm going to be doing a

4
00:00:06,480 --> 00:00:08,960
spider bot and it was suggested by mia

5
00:00:08,960 --> 00:00:09,599
pc

6
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:11,920
and i think she meant it like a spider

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,759
bot so i'm going to do a spider robot if

8
00:00:13,759 --> 00:00:14,880
that's not what you meant

9
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,320
then i got it wrong but i'm going to do

10
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:18,720
it anyway so a little robotic

11
00:00:18,720 --> 00:00:20,800
hard to surface the spider it's going to

12
00:00:20,800 --> 00:00:22,400
be low poly of course no surprise i'm

13
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,840
going to fit it in 10 minutes i'm going

14
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:24,720
to rig it as well

15
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,240
last weekend got a little bit busy as

16
00:00:26,240 --> 00:00:28,560
well first it was my wife's birthday

17
00:00:28,560 --> 00:00:29,279
actually on

18
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:30,880
the friday so we had a good time there

19
00:00:30,880 --> 00:00:32,000
spent time with the family and

20
00:00:32,000 --> 00:00:33,040
celebrated that

21
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:35,040
and then on the weekend we did a lot of

22
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:36,719
housework so we started to tear down a

23
00:00:36,719 --> 00:00:37,440
balcony

24
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:39,680
and of course there was ludum there 48

25
00:00:39,680 --> 00:00:41,520
and i sort of a little bit forgot about

26
00:00:41,520 --> 00:00:42,640
it so i

27
00:00:42,640 --> 00:00:44,000
just had to do what i could i didn't

28
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:46,160
want to miss out on my 13th

29
00:00:46,160 --> 00:00:49,120
consecutive participation of ludum there

30
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:50,719
but i had to scale it down so i did a

31
00:00:50,719 --> 00:00:52,079
little diving game and

32
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:55,120
uh very unimaginable very little

33
00:00:55,120 --> 00:00:56,800
innovation when it comes to this one and

34
00:00:56,800 --> 00:00:58,640
originality it just flushed down the

35
00:00:58,640 --> 00:00:59,440
toilet

36
00:00:59,440 --> 00:01:01,199
and when i told my wife what i did she's

37
00:01:01,199 --> 00:01:03,440
just going god couldn't you come up with

38
00:01:03,440 --> 00:01:05,119
anything better than that

39
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:08,080
but the game's called deep blue wow

40
00:01:08,080 --> 00:01:10,640
surprising original yeah i know

41
00:01:10,640 --> 00:01:12,159
and it's a deep diving like a free

42
00:01:12,159 --> 00:01:13,920
diving game so i modeled a little

43
00:01:13,920 --> 00:01:14,560
character

44
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:16,240
and it had some new challenges actually

45
00:01:16,240 --> 00:01:17,759
but it was good to learn

46
00:01:17,759 --> 00:01:19,360
first of all i'm not used to modeling

47
00:01:19,360 --> 00:01:20,960
characters being upside down

48
00:01:20,960 --> 00:01:22,560
and with the leg movements i'm so used

49
00:01:22,560 --> 00:01:24,159
to inverse kinematics and the walk

50
00:01:24,159 --> 00:01:24,799
cycles

51
00:01:24,799 --> 00:01:26,320
so when i'm going to do the flippers and

52
00:01:26,320 --> 00:01:27,920
when he was swimming down it was a

53
00:01:27,920 --> 00:01:29,439
little bit trickier than i thought

54
00:01:29,439 --> 00:01:31,439
so that was a bit of a good practice and

55
00:01:31,439 --> 00:01:33,119
there was a few other things i did an

56
00:01:33,119 --> 00:01:33,759
inverted

57
00:01:33,759 --> 00:01:35,680
ragdoll which was quite fun that's

58
00:01:35,680 --> 00:01:37,119
another new one for me because

59
00:01:37,119 --> 00:01:38,560
usually i just do a ragdoll apply

60
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
physics and let them drop but this one

61
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:42,799
i had to do a ragdoll basically like

62
00:01:42,799 --> 00:01:43,439
before

63
00:01:43,439 --> 00:01:45,439
but i inverted gravity and i had to do

64
00:01:45,439 --> 00:01:47,920
the angular drag and the drag of all the

65
00:01:47,920 --> 00:01:49,119
joints a little bit so it looks like

66
00:01:49,119 --> 00:01:50,720
he's floating up

67
00:01:50,720 --> 00:01:52,960
and for the depth of the water just to

68
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,040
make that blue shades i didn't really go

69
00:01:55,040 --> 00:01:57,200
all in with volumetrics and stuff like

70
00:01:57,200 --> 00:01:59,360
that i did it uh the cheating way that's

71
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,479
what

72
00:02:00,479 --> 00:02:02,079
that's me uh i was gonna say that was me

73
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:04,159
that's not me but the uh

74
00:02:04,159 --> 00:02:06,000
uh oh yeah i just put a lot of

75
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,000
transparent sheets between uh

76
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,598
like different layers of the background

77
00:02:09,598 --> 00:02:11,599
so it gradually shaded it towards

78
00:02:11,599 --> 00:02:14,000
like a blue color for the depth so you

79
00:02:14,000 --> 00:02:15,840
can download that unity project and if

80
00:02:15,840 --> 00:02:17,040
you want to have a look at it it looks a

81
00:02:17,040 --> 00:02:17,840
total mess

82
00:02:17,840 --> 00:02:20,000
it's like hack and slash just make it

83
00:02:20,000 --> 00:02:21,040
work within the

84
00:02:21,040 --> 00:02:23,520
uh within the time and i guess you have

85
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:24,959
48 hours for ludum there

86
00:02:24,959 --> 00:02:28,160
leave them there 48 48 hours that was a

87
00:02:28,160 --> 00:02:29,280
bit of a coincidence

88
00:02:29,280 --> 00:02:31,120
but i managed to put 15 hours into the

89
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,720
game and uh considering that little

90
00:02:32,720 --> 00:02:34,000
amount of time i was happy with the

91
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,760
result and i also wanted to make

92
00:02:35,760 --> 00:02:37,519
my first one-click game so there's only

93
00:02:37,519 --> 00:02:38,879
one button that you need to do in the

94
00:02:38,879 --> 00:02:39,840
whole game and that's

95
00:02:39,840 --> 00:02:42,319
press spacebar but if you time the swim

96
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:43,840
downs then you can go a little bit

97
00:02:43,840 --> 00:02:45,680
faster so you can reach that depth

98
00:02:45,680 --> 00:02:47,599
and the theme of course was deeper and

99
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,920
deeper so i thought every time you go

100
00:02:49,920 --> 00:02:50,319
you're

101
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:51,920
going to go a little bit deeper it's

102
00:02:51,920 --> 00:02:54,640
time to model a spiderbot and

103
00:02:54,640 --> 00:02:55,920
i'm going to go for the old cool palette

104
00:02:55,920 --> 00:02:58,080
again the solid link is

105
00:02:58,080 --> 00:02:59,840
might be in the description let's go

106
00:02:59,840 --> 00:03:01,599
ready steady go

107
00:03:01,599 --> 00:03:04,720
we're off tap into the mode a select

108
00:03:04,720 --> 00:03:05,200
everything

109
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:08,080
g oh no first of all of course bottom

110
00:03:08,080 --> 00:03:08,879
mirror

111
00:03:08,879 --> 00:03:12,640
a g move it up scale it down bring it in

112
00:03:12,640 --> 00:03:14,640
and here i'm going to copy this for the

113
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,080
legs shift d

114
00:03:16,080 --> 00:03:18,480
and copy this for like a little gun

115
00:03:18,480 --> 00:03:20,319
turret at the top here

116
00:03:20,319 --> 00:03:23,920
l scale y control r

117
00:03:23,920 --> 00:03:26,080
maybe six loop cuts on this one because

118
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:28,239
then you get a nice even number to

119
00:03:28,239 --> 00:03:30,159
do this little effect with that we're

120
00:03:30,159 --> 00:03:32,000
gonna use so we're gonna do i to inset

121
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:33,440
b to get the root of the boundary in the

122
00:03:33,440 --> 00:03:36,480
center alt s to scale it down

123
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,400
and here let's do like a head so ctrl r

124
00:03:40,400 --> 00:03:44,159
scale it out there maybe bring that down

125
00:03:44,159 --> 00:03:46,480
and here we go i'm just gonna do some

126
00:03:46,480 --> 00:03:47,200
sort of a

127
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:50,959
like spider-like body or something

128
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:53,360
i don't know g okay hey select

129
00:03:53,360 --> 00:03:54,400
everything let's make it a little bit

130
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:55,519
darker this time

131
00:03:55,519 --> 00:03:58,879
dark spider like in minecraft g orange

132
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:02,239
bit robotic no minecraft anymore g

133
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,400
to move that on i think that should do

134
00:04:04,400 --> 00:04:07,360
and make a little bit point here

135
00:04:07,360 --> 00:04:10,400
and we can do an i here so i to inset oh

136
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:13,920
i to inset the eye hilarious not really

137
00:04:13,920 --> 00:04:14,640
g

138
00:04:14,640 --> 00:04:16,238
red spin cycle on the washing machine is

139
00:04:16,238 --> 00:04:18,160
going up again bear with it

140
00:04:18,160 --> 00:04:21,199
stay with me let's see g okay

141
00:04:21,199 --> 00:04:23,120
i haven't started the legs yet so let's

142
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:26,000
that's the eye let's do it like

143
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,320
scale it down archer rotate scale it

144
00:04:28,320 --> 00:04:29,360
down i'm going to do

145
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,240
period and do uh no i'm not comma and do

146
00:04:32,240 --> 00:04:33,199
normal so we get

147
00:04:33,199 --> 00:04:35,759
the normal directions there e to extrude

148
00:04:35,759 --> 00:04:37,680
e took shoot s to scale e to extrude

149
00:04:37,680 --> 00:04:39,199
e to extrude that's the scale i'll just

150
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:40,800
do like a robotic leg of course

151
00:04:40,800 --> 00:04:44,479
so that's it simple as that and

152
00:04:44,479 --> 00:04:47,759
here let's copy this one shift d

153
00:04:47,759 --> 00:04:49,600
scale it down e to extrude that's the

154
00:04:49,600 --> 00:04:51,040
scale do it like internally like that

155
00:04:51,040 --> 00:04:52,800
don't have to worry about the hydraulics

156
00:04:52,800 --> 00:04:54,080
and stuff like that we should be getting

157
00:04:54,080 --> 00:04:55,520
away with it low poly

158
00:04:55,520 --> 00:04:57,680
we'll get away with it it's extrude sd

159
00:04:57,680 --> 00:04:58,880
scale e2 extrude

160
00:04:58,880 --> 00:05:02,000
sd scale e to extrude no i'm not going

161
00:05:02,000 --> 00:05:02,560
to say

162
00:05:02,560 --> 00:05:05,680
scale that one shift d scale it down e

163
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:06,560
to extrude

164
00:05:06,560 --> 00:05:09,440
s to scale e takes true that's the scale

165
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:10,479
e to extrude

166
00:05:10,479 --> 00:05:12,080
e texture s this game and i'm going to

167
00:05:12,080 --> 00:05:13,840
do like spiky legs here so i don't have

168
00:05:13,840 --> 00:05:15,600
to worry about feet 7 47 on the clock

169
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:16,400
here

170
00:05:16,400 --> 00:05:18,960
i'm gonna do l to select the linked hair

171
00:05:18,960 --> 00:05:20,800
though and rotate this

172
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:24,080
so the legs don't get too long

173
00:05:24,080 --> 00:05:27,199
so g okay e to extrude i'll just

174
00:05:27,199 --> 00:05:28,800
all the way down to the tip you know

175
00:05:28,800 --> 00:05:30,479
scale pointy

176
00:05:30,479 --> 00:05:33,039
feet there ctrl r but i'll chunk them up

177
00:05:33,039 --> 00:05:34,479
a little bit here

178
00:05:34,479 --> 00:05:36,400
put some features here now i'm gonna do

179
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,160
some shields of some sort here

180
00:05:38,160 --> 00:05:40,160
so let's just do uh let's select that

181
00:05:40,160 --> 00:05:42,560
one each extruder i'm going to attach it

182
00:05:42,560 --> 00:05:43,919
to the actual leg so it's a little bit

183
00:05:43,919 --> 00:05:45,120
easier to weight paint because we have

184
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,720
to do manual weight painting for this

185
00:05:46,720 --> 00:05:49,680
need to extrude so let's do the shield

186
00:05:49,680 --> 00:05:50,000
here

187
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:52,960
the leg shield e to extrude for the

188
00:05:52,960 --> 00:05:54,240
spider bot

189
00:05:54,240 --> 00:05:58,000
e to extrude r to rotate and then

190
00:05:58,000 --> 00:06:01,360
let's shift select a few of these

191
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:05,360
and alt t extrude long face normals

192
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,400
g to move it down scale z no

193
00:06:08,400 --> 00:06:11,680
x no y okay no apparently no axis

194
00:06:11,680 --> 00:06:14,720
so let's leave it then and

195
00:06:14,720 --> 00:06:17,039
g to move that on spiky i think the

196
00:06:17,039 --> 00:06:20,000
washing machines don't know

197
00:06:20,000 --> 00:06:22,720
to move that on okay this should do and

198
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,720
then uh i'll do features here as well so

199
00:06:24,720 --> 00:06:25,520
maybe i'll

200
00:06:25,520 --> 00:06:28,720
gg something wrong

201
00:06:28,720 --> 00:06:30,639
oh yeah that's because that one so ctrl

202
00:06:30,639 --> 00:06:31,759
r let's do

203
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,880
four here i'll select these

204
00:06:34,880 --> 00:06:37,919
item set alt test to scale them down and

205
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:39,199
make them orange

206
00:06:39,199 --> 00:06:43,120
and then here 621 we'll do the same type

207
00:06:43,120 --> 00:06:44,560
of feature here

208
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:47,199
so b to extrude e to extrude but here

209
00:06:47,199 --> 00:06:48,800
i'll just do one i think like this e to

210
00:06:48,800 --> 00:06:50,560
explode like a shield here on the leg as

211
00:06:50,560 --> 00:06:51,440
well

212
00:06:51,440 --> 00:06:54,160
all d to extrude long face normals is

213
00:06:54,160 --> 00:06:57,440
that even what i'm doing i hope so

214
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:01,199
g move that one and should we do

215
00:07:01,199 --> 00:07:04,080
move that one up ctrl r we'll just do

216
00:07:04,080 --> 00:07:05,360
one loop here

217
00:07:05,360 --> 00:07:07,840
height inset all test is scaled down

218
00:07:07,840 --> 00:07:09,440
orange

219
00:07:09,440 --> 00:07:11,199
and here it felt like it was a bit too

220
00:07:11,199 --> 00:07:12,720
thick so

221
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:14,800
let's do shift select these and spike

222
00:07:14,800 --> 00:07:17,199
this up as well don't need to protect

223
00:07:17,199 --> 00:07:20,080
the leg that much that should do and

224
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:21,520
should we do some something weird

225
00:07:21,520 --> 00:07:24,720
no i think that should be all right

226
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:26,720
dude e to extrude that's the scale

227
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:30,720
little details here okay never mind

228
00:07:30,720 --> 00:07:33,919
and now i'll do the torrent turret so

229
00:07:33,919 --> 00:07:35,599
g to move that one back to there e to

230
00:07:35,599 --> 00:07:37,120
extrude i'll just do something super

231
00:07:37,120 --> 00:07:39,039
simple e to extrude s to scale e to

232
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,240
extrude

233
00:07:40,240 --> 00:07:43,280
and then h extrude s to scale and then

234
00:07:43,280 --> 00:07:45,599
here i'm just going to do like a cannon

235
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:48,000
or a gun let's just call it a gun shift

236
00:07:48,000 --> 00:07:50,560
d duplicate that on the scale

237
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:53,599
bring it down to there and bring it in

238
00:07:53,599 --> 00:07:55,039
because it's going to have like a recoil

239
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:57,199
effector e to extrude you to extrude

240
00:07:57,199 --> 00:07:58,160
again

241
00:07:58,160 --> 00:08:03,039
s to scale a little bit taller y

242
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:07,599
okay comma and do global again

243
00:08:07,599 --> 00:08:10,080
and then e to extrude e to extrude

244
00:08:10,080 --> 00:08:11,440
that's the scale

245
00:08:11,440 --> 00:08:14,319
e to extrude here's just like the tip of

246
00:08:14,319 --> 00:08:14,639
the

247
00:08:14,639 --> 00:08:17,919
gun or something e to extrude

248
00:08:17,919 --> 00:08:21,599
s to scale item set b for boundary and e

249
00:08:21,599 --> 00:08:22,800
to extrude in

250
00:08:22,800 --> 00:08:25,520
that's a big cannon big cannon hole ctrl

251
00:08:25,520 --> 00:08:27,840
r six loop cuts

252
00:08:27,840 --> 00:08:29,759
maybe that was too many i don't know

253
00:08:29,759 --> 00:08:31,120
let's do those

254
00:08:31,120 --> 00:08:33,360
like indentations here as well i'll test

255
00:08:33,360 --> 00:08:36,080
to scale that on

256
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:38,479
let me bring those up and here should we

257
00:08:38,479 --> 00:08:39,839
do like a shield in the back here as

258
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:40,080
well

259
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,519
all the extra long oh all the

260
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:47,120
extruded face normals scale z

261
00:08:47,120 --> 00:08:51,600
rotate g e took screwed as the scale

262
00:08:51,600 --> 00:08:54,480
and we'll do those i'll just do one here

263
00:08:54,480 --> 00:08:56,720
as well

264
00:08:56,720 --> 00:08:59,920
alt s scale it down g okay

265
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:02,240
four minutes to go let's try to rig this

266
00:09:02,240 --> 00:09:04,080
and i have to figure out how to do this

267
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,240
now

268
00:09:06,240 --> 00:09:08,800
because let's do some maybe dark parts

269
00:09:08,800 --> 00:09:10,160
here too

270
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:13,680
okay okay uh

271
00:09:13,680 --> 00:09:16,080
so to do this i need to do more legs

272
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,120
here

273
00:09:17,120 --> 00:09:19,200
g to move uh i have to first of all do

274
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:20,839
the armature shift a

275
00:09:20,839 --> 00:09:24,240
armature and here

276
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,880
let's go into this tab and do viewport

277
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:28,160
in front

278
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,160
tab in credit mode i've got three

279
00:09:30,160 --> 00:09:31,519
minutes to to

280
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,399
awesome i was trying to call rotate

281
00:09:34,399 --> 00:09:35,200
minus

282
00:09:35,200 --> 00:09:38,720
90. ah can't answer now maybe that's the

283
00:09:38,720 --> 00:09:40,560
fiber

284
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,200
uh i'll just have to decline for now and

285
00:09:43,200 --> 00:09:44,880
pick up after

286
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:48,320
shift space g uh shift d that's for the

287
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:50,160
turret that's for the gun

288
00:09:50,160 --> 00:09:53,360
and name this one root

289
00:09:53,360 --> 00:09:57,040
name this one turret name this one

290
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,920
gun and then we'll do this one needs to

291
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:00,720
be connected

292
00:10:00,720 --> 00:10:03,040
so control p keep offset and this one

293
00:10:03,040 --> 00:10:04,560
needs to become vectors one

294
00:10:04,560 --> 00:10:07,040
keep opposite and i have to do the legs

295
00:10:07,040 --> 00:10:09,839
so e to extrude

296
00:10:09,839 --> 00:10:12,560
g to move it g to move that one down oh

297
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,760
i have to do inverse kinematics with

298
00:10:13,760 --> 00:10:14,880
this two two forty eight

299
00:10:14,880 --> 00:10:17,120
this is not gonna work i'm panicking now

300
00:10:17,120 --> 00:10:18,480
fail duck might be coming up

301
00:10:18,480 --> 00:10:21,839
uh let's see so

302
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,320
i have to compare that one control p

303
00:10:24,320 --> 00:10:26,160
keep offset

304
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:30,640
leg a dot l zero zero one

305
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:34,320
weird name and g to move that on down

306
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:37,839
e texture down up to no

307
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,399
g there i need to extrude it down to the

308
00:10:40,399 --> 00:10:42,480
tip

309
00:10:42,480 --> 00:10:45,279
and this needs to be segment b but leg

310
00:10:45,279 --> 00:10:47,279
one and this one needs to be ligament

311
00:10:47,279 --> 00:10:50,800
legacy let's see one still

312
00:10:50,800 --> 00:10:52,959
i feel panic now two minutes to go each

313
00:10:52,959 --> 00:10:54,160
extrude uh

314
00:10:54,160 --> 00:10:57,200
p now alt p clear apparent

315
00:10:57,200 --> 00:10:58,959
g to move down high up because this is

316
00:10:58,959 --> 00:11:00,800
going to be the pole target

317
00:11:00,800 --> 00:11:04,000
for some flippy legs i need to find the

318
00:11:04,000 --> 00:11:07,440
d4 needs to go off and then e to extrude

319
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:08,160
on

320
00:11:08,160 --> 00:11:12,160
alt p clear parent deform off

321
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,200
ik target dot l

322
00:11:15,200 --> 00:11:18,800
dot zero zero one i k

323
00:11:18,800 --> 00:11:22,079
poll dot l zero zero one

324
00:11:22,079 --> 00:11:23,839
and now i do have to do the image

325
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:26,160
kinematics two so i have to go control

326
00:11:26,160 --> 00:11:26,640
tab

327
00:11:26,640 --> 00:11:29,680
pose mode did i name this correctly yeah

328
00:11:29,680 --> 00:11:32,959
uh 132. um honeykin uh inverse

329
00:11:32,959 --> 00:11:34,000
kinematics

330
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:36,320
there and we need three segments this

331
00:11:36,320 --> 00:11:37,040
time

332
00:11:37,040 --> 00:11:41,440
and here's the armature so armature

333
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:44,480
and ik target here's the armature ik

334
00:11:44,480 --> 00:11:47,839
pole and that's flipped out i have to do

335
00:11:47,839 --> 00:11:50,639
a to select everything shift n view axis

336
00:11:50,639 --> 00:11:52,160
roll calculation

337
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,639
tab again and we have to do this one

338
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:55,600
this

339
00:11:55,600 --> 00:11:59,040
180 because it's probably yeah that like

340
00:11:59,040 --> 00:12:00,320
works control tab

341
00:12:00,320 --> 00:12:03,040
okay now i need to duplicate this so

342
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,320
shift select these

343
00:12:04,320 --> 00:12:08,079
uh 57 seconds to go this

344
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:11,360
uh let's see i'll move that one to

345
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:15,120
g minus one okay g

346
00:12:15,120 --> 00:12:18,560
there two minus one

347
00:12:18,560 --> 00:12:21,760
minus two okay um

348
00:12:21,760 --> 00:12:25,680
let's move shift d two shift d

349
00:12:25,680 --> 00:12:29,600
two okay thirty four seconds

350
00:12:29,600 --> 00:12:32,320
uh tab inside mode l to select all the

351
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,560
links here

352
00:12:33,560 --> 00:12:35,440
[Music]

353
00:12:35,440 --> 00:12:38,800
and then back shift d to

354
00:12:38,800 --> 00:12:43,519
shift d minus two oh no

355
00:12:43,519 --> 00:12:47,760
ah top view g

356
00:12:47,760 --> 00:12:51,200
minus four that's it

357
00:12:51,200 --> 00:12:53,600
and here we go 10 seconds to go and i'm

358
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:54,560
gonna actually move these

359
00:12:54,560 --> 00:12:58,000
a little bit closer again l

360
00:12:58,240 --> 00:13:07,839
shift select everything and

361
00:13:09,440 --> 00:13:12,639
great great

362
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:15,120
so the 10 minutes are up and i did

363
00:13:15,120 --> 00:13:17,519
manage to sort of model a spiderbot

364
00:13:17,519 --> 00:13:21,440
and i created the armature roughly

365
00:13:21,440 --> 00:13:23,920
but i failed to link it up and you can't

366
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:25,600
do automatic weights with this anyway so

367
00:13:25,600 --> 00:13:27,120
i don't think i was even close when it

368
00:13:27,120 --> 00:13:28,399
came to it at the end here

369
00:13:28,399 --> 00:13:30,320
so the idea was to do a rigged spider

370
00:13:30,320 --> 00:13:32,000
bot in 10 minutes

371
00:13:32,000 --> 00:13:33,920
and that sort of failed so i'm gonna

372
00:13:33,920 --> 00:13:35,600
have to move into the bonus content now

373
00:13:35,600 --> 00:13:35,920
and

374
00:13:35,920 --> 00:13:37,600
rig it and we'll do a little animation

375
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:39,199
for this spiderbot as well

376
00:13:39,199 --> 00:13:41,440
but when you think about it maybe was it

377
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,760
a fail or was it a huge success because

378
00:13:43,760 --> 00:13:45,120
i managed to model

379
00:13:45,120 --> 00:13:47,680
the spiderbot well within the 10 minutes

380
00:13:47,680 --> 00:13:48,240
so

381
00:13:48,240 --> 00:13:49,839
this is the bonus material now and this

382
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,680
is where we take care of the rest of the

383
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:52,160
rigging

384
00:13:52,160 --> 00:13:54,560
and the animating let's try to just

385
00:13:54,560 --> 00:13:55,519
ignore that

386
00:13:55,519 --> 00:13:57,360
everything that just happened and let's

387
00:13:57,360 --> 00:13:59,199
move on let's proceed okay so

388
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,560
i'm still going to try to keep the pace

389
00:14:00,560 --> 00:14:02,880
up though a little bit

390
00:14:02,880 --> 00:14:04,800
but it's weird without the pressure on

391
00:14:04,800 --> 00:14:06,560
kind of keep the pace open

392
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:07,839
you should always work on the pressure

393
00:14:07,839 --> 00:14:09,680
it's always a lot better

394
00:14:09,680 --> 00:14:11,519
so what we're going to do here let's

395
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,800
take these bones here

396
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:15,040
shift space g i'm going to move them a

397
00:14:15,040 --> 00:14:16,480
little bit closer together again because

398
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:17,920
i think they ended up a little bit far

399
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:19,199
apart

400
00:14:19,199 --> 00:14:22,880
so let's shift select a bunch of those

401
00:14:22,880 --> 00:14:25,680
and move them up okay i need to move the

402
00:14:25,680 --> 00:14:28,079
whole bone

403
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:30,399
oh the the tempo significantly drops

404
00:14:30,399 --> 00:14:32,160
after the pressure is off

405
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,519
so g um

406
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,720
let's do on this axis 0.5

407
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,320
that's a little bit better i think and

408
00:14:40,320 --> 00:14:44,560
then we'll move this one down too

409
00:14:44,560 --> 00:14:48,000
shift select those g minus

410
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,320
0.5 there we go and then we'll do the

411
00:14:50,320 --> 00:14:51,360
same for the legs here

412
00:14:51,360 --> 00:14:55,839
so l l l to select linked g

413
00:14:55,839 --> 00:14:59,199
middle mouse button zero negative zero

414
00:14:59,199 --> 00:14:59,519
point

415
00:14:59,519 --> 00:15:04,079
five start ll g

416
00:15:04,079 --> 00:15:08,320
0.5 okay so the idea now would be to

417
00:15:08,320 --> 00:15:10,480
let's see everything's there since i

418
00:15:10,480 --> 00:15:11,519
named them the way i did

419
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:13,040
we can parent these now i think

420
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,720
everything's pretty much set up i've got

421
00:15:14,720 --> 00:15:16,480
the inverse kinematics we had that in

422
00:15:16,480 --> 00:15:17,120
time though

423
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,760
so that worked within the time limit

424
00:15:19,760 --> 00:15:21,120
that's pretty good

425
00:15:21,120 --> 00:15:24,000
could've been worse so with this done i

426
00:15:24,000 --> 00:15:27,120
think it's time to do them symmetrize so

427
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:29,839
a to select everything no tab into edit

428
00:15:29,839 --> 00:15:32,079
mode on the armature a select everything

429
00:15:32,079 --> 00:15:34,639
f3 oh that's cache since the last

430
00:15:34,639 --> 00:15:35,120
challenge

431
00:15:35,120 --> 00:15:38,560
symmetrize there we go and that one's

432
00:15:38,560 --> 00:15:41,040
all symmetrized

433
00:15:41,040 --> 00:15:44,320
and control tab post mode the inverse

434
00:15:44,320 --> 00:15:45,680
kinematics everything works

435
00:15:45,680 --> 00:15:47,920
for both legs yeah that works and this

436
00:15:47,920 --> 00:15:48,720
works so

437
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:50,959
let's uh parent it we have to do a

438
00:15:50,959 --> 00:15:52,480
little bit different because uh

439
00:15:52,480 --> 00:15:53,920
now since we're outside of the 10

440
00:15:53,920 --> 00:15:55,759
minutes bonus

441
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,160
then when we parent this i can show you

442
00:15:58,160 --> 00:15:59,519
that we don't really want to use

443
00:15:59,519 --> 00:16:01,279
automatic weights because if i do that

444
00:16:01,279 --> 00:16:03,440
ctrl p so i shift select there first i

445
00:16:03,440 --> 00:16:04,480
select the

446
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,480
mesh shift selected the armature control

447
00:16:06,480 --> 00:16:08,480
p if i do the automatic weights

448
00:16:08,480 --> 00:16:11,519
now it sort of works but if you look

449
00:16:11,519 --> 00:16:14,399
here ctrl tab into post mode

450
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,880
g and see that it's moving the face and

451
00:16:16,880 --> 00:16:18,720
it's distorting the legs a little bit

452
00:16:18,720 --> 00:16:20,079
so you don't really get that hard

453
00:16:20,079 --> 00:16:21,759
feeling but it did actually do a pretty

454
00:16:21,759 --> 00:16:22,000
good

455
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:24,800
job but this is no good so instead of

456
00:16:24,800 --> 00:16:26,000
doing that we want to lock

457
00:16:26,000 --> 00:16:29,040
everything 100 in place so to do that

458
00:16:29,040 --> 00:16:31,680
let's controls that out now i'm going to

459
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:32,079
do

460
00:16:32,079 --> 00:16:34,800
again select the mesh shift select the

461
00:16:34,800 --> 00:16:35,440
armature

462
00:16:35,440 --> 00:16:37,839
control p and then do with empty groups

463
00:16:37,839 --> 00:16:39,279
i've done this a few times in the past

464
00:16:39,279 --> 00:16:39,600
for

465
00:16:39,600 --> 00:16:42,480
like the mech warrior type thing but

466
00:16:42,480 --> 00:16:43,120
let's do it

467
00:16:43,120 --> 00:16:45,440
we'll start with the body here so tab

468
00:16:45,440 --> 00:16:46,240
into edit mode

469
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:49,440
l to select this one ctrl g and set

470
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,839
active group okay we didn't name this

471
00:16:51,839 --> 00:16:54,240
one apparently root so let's

472
00:16:54,240 --> 00:16:57,120
let's do that first

473
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,880
f2 i thought it did

474
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,839
ah did i name that one okay

475
00:17:07,199 --> 00:17:09,679
tourette's

476
00:17:10,799 --> 00:17:14,079
uh root

477
00:17:17,599 --> 00:17:19,119
i alright do like a programmer's

478
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:22,000
tourettes like singleton singleton

479
00:17:22,000 --> 00:17:23,679
singleton garbage collection garbage

480
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,119
collection

481
00:17:25,119 --> 00:17:28,240
let's go l select the linked purchases

482
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:28,960
for the body

483
00:17:28,960 --> 00:17:32,000
and then now we'll do ctrl g set active

484
00:17:32,000 --> 00:17:36,880
group root ctrl g assign to active group

485
00:17:36,880 --> 00:17:38,400
l this is going to be a bit repetitive

486
00:17:38,400 --> 00:17:40,000
control g

487
00:17:40,000 --> 00:17:43,280
set active group turret

488
00:17:44,480 --> 00:17:46,799
ctrl g still a side tag to group you get

489
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:47,840
a little bit faster when you've done it

490
00:17:47,840 --> 00:17:48,799
a few times so

491
00:17:48,799 --> 00:17:52,160
l control g set active group gone

492
00:17:52,160 --> 00:17:54,640
ctrl g assigned to actually group and

493
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,160
now comes the fun part we have to do it

494
00:17:56,160 --> 00:17:57,120
for the legs so

495
00:17:57,120 --> 00:17:59,440
l that's why we sort of named them a

496
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:00,559
little bit decently

497
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,679
control g set active group

498
00:18:03,679 --> 00:18:07,280
leg a l.001 so i'm just going to do it

499
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,799
now instead of saying all this so we'll

500
00:18:08,799 --> 00:18:10,080
do this one

501
00:18:10,080 --> 00:18:11,280
and you get start to get into the

502
00:18:11,280 --> 00:18:13,520
repetitive moment here so

503
00:18:13,520 --> 00:18:18,640
you can slow this down if you need to l

504
00:18:18,799 --> 00:18:22,960
g and this one this one ctrl g

505
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:25,039
assign type group that's why it's good

506
00:18:25,039 --> 00:18:26,799
to have all the leg components attached

507
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:28,640
to each other as well

508
00:18:28,640 --> 00:18:31,600
because it makes this uh sub part a

509
00:18:31,600 --> 00:18:35,280
little bit easier i tried with them

510
00:18:35,280 --> 00:18:36,640
i can't really speak and do this at the

511
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,480
same time but i have tried with

512
00:18:38,480 --> 00:18:40,080
envelopes instead of automatic weights

513
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:41,360
and that doesn't really work so well

514
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:42,320
either so this is

515
00:18:42,320 --> 00:18:43,840
pretty much the only way i've found to

516
00:18:43,840 --> 00:18:45,919
do the hard surface

517
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:48,080
stuff when i connect them up and a

518
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,679
spider shooter i have eight legs

519
00:18:49,679 --> 00:18:53,360
i only did six legs ah that was to save

520
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,760
some time

521
00:18:55,760 --> 00:18:57,280
and it looks cool enough i think with

522
00:18:57,280 --> 00:18:58,960
six legs so ctrl

523
00:18:58,960 --> 00:19:01,120
l set active group and here we go the

524
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:02,480
last one

525
00:19:02,480 --> 00:19:04,880
this one control a hope i remember to

526
00:19:04,880 --> 00:19:05,760
assign them all here

527
00:19:05,760 --> 00:19:08,640
l control g

528
00:19:08,880 --> 00:19:11,280
there control g active group and the

529
00:19:11,280 --> 00:19:12,000
last one

530
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:14,080
l we have only have to do one side sec

531
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:15,280
active group

532
00:19:15,280 --> 00:19:18,640
like oh nearly another one no it was the

533
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:19,919
wrong one not nearly it was the wrong

534
00:19:19,919 --> 00:19:20,240
one

535
00:19:20,240 --> 00:19:22,400
it was nearly the right one and a

536
00:19:22,400 --> 00:19:23,360
scientific group

537
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:26,720
okay now we can check it ctrl

538
00:19:26,720 --> 00:19:30,000
tab post mode g

539
00:19:30,000 --> 00:19:32,880
will it move that moved this one moved

540
00:19:32,880 --> 00:19:33,520
and

541
00:19:33,520 --> 00:19:34,960
that one moved and these should work

542
00:19:34,960 --> 00:19:37,520
then yep

543
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,480
success and the poll targets here will

544
00:19:40,480 --> 00:19:41,600
aim the legs

545
00:19:41,600 --> 00:19:44,160
so that's done um we should also try to

546
00:19:44,160 --> 00:19:45,360
animate this one because

547
00:19:45,360 --> 00:19:47,520
i haven't really modeled any i haven't

548
00:19:47,520 --> 00:19:49,120
really animated stuff that's not

549
00:19:49,120 --> 00:19:52,080
like a bipedal thing so let's go into

550
00:19:52,080 --> 00:19:53,200
the animation tab

551
00:19:53,200 --> 00:19:55,039
we'll do the right thing first set this

552
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:56,480
one to texture and

553
00:19:56,480 --> 00:19:59,840
shadow and we'll do cavity of course

554
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,640
both so we get a pretty interface here

555
00:20:02,640 --> 00:20:04,240
when we look so

556
00:20:04,240 --> 00:20:05,679
here we go there's the spider with a

557
00:20:05,679 --> 00:20:08,080
little cannon on so let's animate it

558
00:20:08,080 --> 00:20:10,559
first of all i'll go to the action

559
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:12,799
editor here instead

560
00:20:12,799 --> 00:20:14,400
bring this one up and let's create a new

561
00:20:14,400 --> 00:20:17,039
action let's call this one

562
00:20:17,039 --> 00:20:19,200
uh just we can't call it t-post because

563
00:20:19,200 --> 00:20:20,559
it's not a t-pose we'll call it

564
00:20:20,559 --> 00:20:23,200
uh just default i'll do an underscore as

565
00:20:23,200 --> 00:20:24,000
well

566
00:20:24,000 --> 00:20:26,880
remember your neutral pose put an

567
00:20:26,880 --> 00:20:28,240
underscore at the top of the actions

568
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:29,600
because when you import it into

569
00:20:29,600 --> 00:20:31,280
especially unity i don't know about the

570
00:20:31,280 --> 00:20:33,039
other game engines but it inherits the

571
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,000
post from the first

572
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:37,280
action so tip pro tip

573
00:20:37,280 --> 00:20:41,039
from an from an amateur so there we go

574
00:20:41,039 --> 00:20:43,200
uh a little shield light come to protect

575
00:20:43,200 --> 00:20:45,360
that from deletion and go back to

576
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:48,320
first frame here and now we'll do item

577
00:20:48,320 --> 00:20:49,120
search

578
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:50,960
not inset this time and location and

579
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,799
rotation and that creates that frame so

580
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:54,080
we've got the default post there for

581
00:20:54,080 --> 00:20:55,120
everything

582
00:20:55,120 --> 00:20:56,720
now should we do like an idle post as

583
00:20:56,720 --> 00:20:58,320
well we'll do

584
00:20:58,320 --> 00:21:00,720
idle

585
00:21:01,440 --> 00:21:04,400
little idol billy idol no it's a spider

586
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:05,280
idol

587
00:21:05,280 --> 00:21:09,039
there we go so on the idle frame

588
00:21:09,039 --> 00:21:12,080
i'll spread the legs out of it g to move

589
00:21:12,080 --> 00:21:13,679
that on

590
00:21:13,679 --> 00:21:16,320
g if you move it from the top view like

591
00:21:16,320 --> 00:21:18,000
this with inverse kinematics the feet

592
00:21:18,000 --> 00:21:19,360
will always be anchored

593
00:21:19,360 --> 00:21:22,320
really well to the ground so i y you

594
00:21:22,320 --> 00:21:24,799
move them perfectly along that axis

595
00:21:24,799 --> 00:21:26,000
so i should have actually had the

596
00:21:26,000 --> 00:21:27,760
animation thing take down here for

597
00:21:27,760 --> 00:21:29,840
automatic keyframing so i don't forget

598
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:33,600
insert let's lower the poster there

599
00:21:33,600 --> 00:21:36,240
and should we just do like a wobble

600
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:36,720
bobble

601
00:21:36,720 --> 00:21:40,000
pose here so this one goes down a bit

602
00:21:40,000 --> 00:21:43,280
maybe the bomb goes up and

603
00:21:43,280 --> 00:21:45,280
and we'll just change the pole angles

604
00:21:45,280 --> 00:21:47,440
here a little bit

605
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,520
for some movement of the legs we want

606
00:21:49,520 --> 00:21:50,720
the feet to be anchored though

607
00:21:50,720 --> 00:21:53,039
that's important because you don't want

608
00:21:53,039 --> 00:21:54,240
them to move

609
00:21:54,240 --> 00:21:57,280
around on the ground so

610
00:21:57,280 --> 00:22:00,640
there and there and that's and as we

611
00:22:00,640 --> 00:22:02,159
rotate the body we could

612
00:22:02,159 --> 00:22:06,480
rotate the turret up a little bit oop

613
00:22:06,559 --> 00:22:08,480
to compensate so it look looks like it's

614
00:22:08,480 --> 00:22:11,360
aiming the weapon forward at all times

615
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:14,880
and let's see that works and then

616
00:22:14,880 --> 00:22:17,440
we'll do a to select everything b to box

617
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:18,240
select down there

618
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:20,159
shift d to duplicate on the dope sheet

619
00:22:20,159 --> 00:22:21,840
to frame 40 and we'll do

620
00:22:21,840 --> 00:22:25,840
39 and 8 select everything shift e and

621
00:22:25,840 --> 00:22:26,799
make cyclic

622
00:22:26,799 --> 00:22:28,559
and this one will loop forever then and

623
00:22:28,559 --> 00:22:30,720
make a pretty good

624
00:22:30,720 --> 00:22:34,000
thing so that could be the idle pose for

625
00:22:34,000 --> 00:22:36,400
if we can hide the armature as well now

626
00:22:36,400 --> 00:22:37,679
that the washing machine is finished i

627
00:22:37,679 --> 00:22:38,480
just noticed

628
00:22:38,480 --> 00:22:39,919
i'm hearing that they're drilling in the

629
00:22:39,919 --> 00:22:41,679
road they're cutting the road up outside

630
00:22:41,679 --> 00:22:42,240
but

631
00:22:42,240 --> 00:22:43,840
don't worry it's for a very very good

632
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:46,559
cause we're getting fiber finally so i

633
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:47,840
don't have to stream these things

634
00:22:47,840 --> 00:22:51,120
during my through my 4g little sim card

635
00:22:51,120 --> 00:22:53,120
thing that keeps running out of data

636
00:22:53,120 --> 00:22:55,440
so finally a decent internet connection

637
00:22:55,440 --> 00:22:57,440
all right back to the thing we'll do one

638
00:22:57,440 --> 00:22:58,799
more animation too

639
00:22:58,799 --> 00:23:01,520
so i'll copy this one that's the idle

640
00:23:01,520 --> 00:23:03,280
looks like he's breathing heavily

641
00:23:03,280 --> 00:23:06,559
so wobbling legs there but that's okay

642
00:23:06,559 --> 00:23:09,600
so walk let's try to do a a six-legged

643
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:10,880
walk cycle

644
00:23:10,880 --> 00:23:13,760
okay how's this gonna go we'll have to

645
00:23:13,760 --> 00:23:15,120
show the armature again

646
00:23:15,120 --> 00:23:18,480
press space to stop it let's do

647
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:21,919
go back to frame one and the walk here

648
00:23:21,919 --> 00:23:22,799
and

649
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:26,799
okay so control tab into post mode

650
00:23:26,799 --> 00:23:29,520
select all of them delete everything and

651
00:23:29,520 --> 00:23:31,440
for this one i'm just going to animate

652
00:23:31,440 --> 00:23:33,280
the left side of the spider here first

653
00:23:33,280 --> 00:23:34,720
so i'll take this one

654
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:38,080
this leg let's move it forward this one

655
00:23:38,080 --> 00:23:38,640
goes back

656
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:40,000
and this one goes forward i think it's

657
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:44,000
like a an inverted cycle when they walk

658
00:23:44,000 --> 00:23:48,559
so that one can go forward even to there

659
00:23:48,559 --> 00:23:51,840
and i think i'll skip the pull targets

660
00:23:51,840 --> 00:23:53,120
for now i'll just try to animate the

661
00:23:53,120 --> 00:23:54,080
legs

662
00:23:54,080 --> 00:23:55,919
so i'm going to go forward four frames

663
00:23:55,919 --> 00:23:58,480
one two three four

664
00:23:58,480 --> 00:24:00,159
five six seven eight so i'll go forward

665
00:24:00,159 --> 00:24:01,760
eight frames because now we need to i

666
00:24:01,760 --> 00:24:02,799
think just

667
00:24:02,799 --> 00:24:06,159
move this leg back g maybe to

668
00:24:06,159 --> 00:24:09,520
there this leg goes

669
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:12,480
forward and this leg goes also back so

670
00:24:12,480 --> 00:24:13,840
it's like

671
00:24:13,840 --> 00:24:16,480
the opposite

672
00:24:17,120 --> 00:24:19,039
and we can't have the legs sliding like

673
00:24:19,039 --> 00:24:20,880
this that looks super weird

674
00:24:20,880 --> 00:24:23,200
so instead of him sliding we have to

675
00:24:23,200 --> 00:24:23,919
lift but

676
00:24:23,919 --> 00:24:25,919
only the leg in the middle here needs to

677
00:24:25,919 --> 00:24:27,760
lift because the ones that are moving

678
00:24:27,760 --> 00:24:29,200
backwards are anchored to the ground

679
00:24:29,200 --> 00:24:31,120
pushing the spider forward

680
00:24:31,120 --> 00:24:33,919
so let's go forward halfway there so

681
00:24:33,919 --> 00:24:35,520
four frames and this is the only leg i'm

682
00:24:35,520 --> 00:24:38,080
going to lift up

683
00:24:38,080 --> 00:24:40,159
let's lift it in to shield this body

684
00:24:40,159 --> 00:24:42,559
there too

685
00:24:42,640 --> 00:24:46,080
like this it looks like it's a different

686
00:24:46,080 --> 00:24:47,840
number of keyframes here

687
00:24:47,840 --> 00:24:49,360
i thought it went from four or four

688
00:24:49,360 --> 00:24:50,960
frames one two three

689
00:24:50,960 --> 00:24:54,080
four okay i missed it

690
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:57,279
so move it forward and move there

691
00:24:57,279 --> 00:25:00,400
i think that's should work yeah

692
00:25:00,400 --> 00:25:01,840
and then we have to go back to this of

693
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:06,080
course so shift select these

694
00:25:07,279 --> 00:25:08,880
i'll actually insert the keyframes here

695
00:25:08,880 --> 00:25:10,480
as well i think item set

696
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:15,679
location rotation and then here

697
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,279
i have to think now this one is going to

698
00:25:17,279 --> 00:25:18,720
come back to this post so

699
00:25:18,720 --> 00:25:20,400
and i have to go eight frames in one two

700
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:22,400
three four five six seven eight

701
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,159
oh it's on cyclic that's fine that's why

702
00:25:24,159 --> 00:25:26,240
it's animating without the keyframe

703
00:25:26,240 --> 00:25:28,880
shift e clear cyclic that makes more

704
00:25:28,880 --> 00:25:30,799
sense probably

705
00:25:30,799 --> 00:25:34,559
yeah so and i'm only needing to animate

706
00:25:34,559 --> 00:25:35,919
these uh

707
00:25:35,919 --> 00:25:37,360
the rotations of the bones will take

708
00:25:37,360 --> 00:25:38,640
care of themselves since it's a merged

709
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,480
kinematic so ctrl

710
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,159
c and then here we'll skip in eight

711
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,000
frames one two three four five six seven

712
00:25:44,000 --> 00:25:44,640
eight

713
00:25:44,640 --> 00:25:47,760
control v we're back to there and then

714
00:25:47,760 --> 00:25:49,039
here the only difference here now is

715
00:25:49,039 --> 00:25:50,640
that we need to lift those two legs

716
00:25:50,640 --> 00:25:51,919
because they're moving forward

717
00:25:51,919 --> 00:25:53,440
so this is the only one that anchoring

718
00:25:53,440 --> 00:25:55,200
the spider and we have to mirror it i

719
00:25:55,200 --> 00:25:56,559
think on the other side

720
00:25:56,559 --> 00:25:59,919
so halfway through here

721
00:26:01,520 --> 00:26:04,400
there we go one two three four then

722
00:26:04,400 --> 00:26:05,919
we'll lift these legs up instead

723
00:26:05,919 --> 00:26:09,520
front view g move it

724
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:12,320
and let's protect the body there so that

725
00:26:12,320 --> 00:26:12,960
should be it

726
00:26:12,960 --> 00:26:14,480
maybe you can do this more expressive i

727
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,840
think uh if you tried

728
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:21,039
so there

729
00:26:21,039 --> 00:26:22,799
i think that works and then we'll loop

730
00:26:22,799 --> 00:26:25,279
it on frame 16 here

731
00:26:25,279 --> 00:26:29,919
shift space that works i think

732
00:26:29,919 --> 00:26:31,279
and now we just have to mirror this i

733
00:26:31,279 --> 00:26:32,320
think for the other side and then make

734
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:34,400
the body move a little bit

735
00:26:34,400 --> 00:26:36,400
so it doesn't look so static and i don't

736
00:26:36,400 --> 00:26:37,919
think you can mirror we want

737
00:26:37,919 --> 00:26:40,000
them the post is offset as well so this

738
00:26:40,000 --> 00:26:42,400
could be a little bit tricky

739
00:26:42,400 --> 00:26:46,080
you should insert the location rotation

740
00:26:46,080 --> 00:26:47,120
keyframe there

741
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:48,960
so let's think now i have to copy the

742
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:50,640
mirror post i think i'll do it straight

743
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:51,760
forward first so

744
00:26:51,760 --> 00:26:56,559
control let's see can i do all of this

745
00:26:56,559 --> 00:26:58,720
let's try it on the dope sheet ctrl c

746
00:26:58,720 --> 00:27:00,400
ctrl shift v

747
00:27:00,400 --> 00:27:03,520
okay that didn't work i i don't know if

748
00:27:03,520 --> 00:27:04,240
the

749
00:27:04,240 --> 00:27:05,840
paste mirror post works so well when

750
00:27:05,840 --> 00:27:07,760
it's not like on a humanoid so i'll have

751
00:27:07,760 --> 00:27:09,120
to do them manually maybe

752
00:27:09,120 --> 00:27:12,240
ctrl c ctrl shift v

753
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,080
ctrl c ctrl shift maybe it was the

754
00:27:14,080 --> 00:27:15,600
naming scheme that i used that was

755
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:19,360
broken so that's mirrored

756
00:27:19,360 --> 00:27:21,120
the poses let's just do that for all of

757
00:27:21,120 --> 00:27:23,520
them control c ctrl shift v

758
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,559
ctrl c ctrl shift v ctrl this is a new

759
00:27:26,559 --> 00:27:26,960
one

760
00:27:26,960 --> 00:27:30,720
ctrl c ctrl shift b and then this one

761
00:27:30,720 --> 00:27:32,159
control the reason why you don't see any

762
00:27:32,159 --> 00:27:33,679
difference because when i do ctrl shift

763
00:27:33,679 --> 00:27:34,080
v

764
00:27:34,080 --> 00:27:35,600
it's actually i've only got this one

765
00:27:35,600 --> 00:27:37,279
selected and when i'm pasting it

766
00:27:37,279 --> 00:27:39,520
mirrored it's actually affecting the

767
00:27:39,520 --> 00:27:41,200
dot r bone here that's why it doesn't

768
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:42,640
change down here

769
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:45,760
ctrl c ctrl shift v

770
00:27:45,760 --> 00:27:49,120
ctrl c ctrl shift v and then we've only

771
00:27:49,120 --> 00:27:50,799
got a few more

772
00:27:50,799 --> 00:27:54,000
ctrl c ctrl shift v ctrl c

773
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:57,039
ctrl shift v ctrl c ctrl shift v one

774
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:57,520
more

775
00:27:57,520 --> 00:28:00,000
bear with me why do i change i could

776
00:28:00,000 --> 00:28:01,200
have stopped it from there ctrl c

777
00:28:01,200 --> 00:28:04,480
ctrl shift v ctrl c ctrl shift d ctrl c

778
00:28:04,480 --> 00:28:07,600
ctrl shift b i couldn't be quiet

779
00:28:07,600 --> 00:28:10,480
but i'm not so this won't work either

780
00:28:10,480 --> 00:28:11,039
because

781
00:28:11,039 --> 00:28:12,640
you kind of have it so symmetrical i

782
00:28:12,640 --> 00:28:14,480
don't think so it works works like that

783
00:28:14,480 --> 00:28:16,000
yeah i guess it was a bit robotic

784
00:28:16,000 --> 00:28:18,240
but i think i'll try to mirror it to see

785
00:28:18,240 --> 00:28:20,159
if the not mirror it i'll

786
00:28:20,159 --> 00:28:23,840
offset it so on this side select the

787
00:28:23,840 --> 00:28:26,880
ik target bones and then i think i'll

788
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:28,960
just control

789
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:31,840
i think i only need to there ctrl c and

790
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:32,880
then just control v

791
00:28:32,880 --> 00:28:34,399
now because these are already mirrored

792
00:28:34,399 --> 00:28:36,399
correctly og og

793
00:28:36,399 --> 00:28:40,159
move it in original gamer there we go

794
00:28:40,159 --> 00:28:43,200
and then now i'll delete these

795
00:28:43,200 --> 00:28:46,159
delete g to slide them down this is

796
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:48,559
probably an easy way to do this but

797
00:28:48,559 --> 00:28:51,120
there oh and we've got duplicate frames

798
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,720
here need to get rid of them because

799
00:28:52,720 --> 00:28:53,760
they were duplicate

800
00:28:53,760 --> 00:28:56,880
copied a little bit too many and

801
00:28:56,880 --> 00:28:59,600
there and that one should be the same as

802
00:28:59,600 --> 00:29:01,600
this one yeah

803
00:29:01,600 --> 00:29:03,039
that looks better i think a little bit a

804
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,120
bit more creepier but we need to do

805
00:29:05,120 --> 00:29:06,159
something with the body too

806
00:29:06,159 --> 00:29:09,440
so and i have no idea how to animate the

807
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:11,840
body when it's moving here so let's do

808
00:29:11,840 --> 00:29:13,520
let's tilt it so let's pretend i don't

809
00:29:13,520 --> 00:29:14,880
know there's probably some science to

810
00:29:14,880 --> 00:29:16,399
this which we should be tilting like

811
00:29:16,399 --> 00:29:18,000
where the weight let's put

812
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:19,679
the weight on this one he's moving

813
00:29:19,679 --> 00:29:21,200
forward with two legs so i guess the

814
00:29:21,200 --> 00:29:22,559
most weight would be on the

815
00:29:22,559 --> 00:29:25,200
on this side so to get some sort of

816
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:27,039
realism you should always think about

817
00:29:27,039 --> 00:29:28,480
like center of gravity and stuff when

818
00:29:28,480 --> 00:29:30,320
you animate so let's not think about

819
00:29:30,320 --> 00:29:32,559
that too much

820
00:29:32,559 --> 00:29:34,159
no you should think about it archer

821
00:29:34,159 --> 00:29:36,559
rotate g to move it

822
00:29:36,559 --> 00:29:38,399
to there let's pretend he's got the

823
00:29:38,399 --> 00:29:41,440
weight like shifted over a little bit

824
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:44,320
ctrl c here we can paste the shift a

825
00:29:44,320 --> 00:29:46,240
flip one or something so one two three

826
00:29:46,240 --> 00:29:47,760
four five six seven eight

827
00:29:47,760 --> 00:29:52,080
ctrl shift v that moves it over

828
00:29:52,080 --> 00:29:53,679
and then we have to duplicate this one

829
00:29:53,679 --> 00:29:57,520
on frame 16 control v

830
00:29:58,799 --> 00:30:02,000
okay that's too much way too much

831
00:30:02,000 --> 00:30:04,000
let's do a little bit more subtle then

832
00:30:04,000 --> 00:30:05,120
shall we alt r

833
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:08,960
alt move it rotate

834
00:30:08,960 --> 00:30:13,279
and let's move it down to there ctrl c

835
00:30:13,279 --> 00:30:16,320
frame 8 ctrl shift v ctrl

836
00:30:16,320 --> 00:30:19,440
or frame 16

837
00:30:19,440 --> 00:30:23,840
is a frame 15 that i meant to do

838
00:30:24,559 --> 00:30:29,679
no 17 oh it's frame 17 okay

839
00:30:29,679 --> 00:30:32,960
easy to get confused control v

840
00:30:32,960 --> 00:30:36,080
not control shift

841
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:39,440
yes like it's wrong one two three four

842
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:40,080
five six

843
00:30:40,080 --> 00:30:43,600
seven oh that's on the wrong frame

844
00:30:47,520 --> 00:30:50,240
okay and then maybe we'll do drop it

845
00:30:50,240 --> 00:30:52,399
should we go up to here

846
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:57,440
ctrl c ctrl v

847
00:30:58,880 --> 00:31:03,120
okay and then we could compensate i

848
00:31:03,120 --> 00:31:06,640
think with the turret as well

849
00:31:06,799 --> 00:31:09,039
so it's like a gyro in here are to

850
00:31:09,039 --> 00:31:10,240
rotate

851
00:31:10,240 --> 00:31:14,159
control c

852
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:17,200
and then go to frame nine then ctrl

853
00:31:17,200 --> 00:31:22,399
shift v go to frame 17 control v

854
00:31:22,399 --> 00:31:26,320
all right let's hide the armature

855
00:31:26,320 --> 00:31:27,679
okay that could probably looked a lot

856
00:31:27,679 --> 00:31:29,600
better but i think the general movement

857
00:31:29,600 --> 00:31:31,120
of the leg it looks a bit spiderish i

858
00:31:31,120 --> 00:31:32,720
think

859
00:31:32,720 --> 00:31:34,159
so you could probably spend some more it

860
00:31:34,159 --> 00:31:35,360
should be try to slow it down a bit

861
00:31:35,360 --> 00:31:36,480
maybe it's too fast

862
00:31:36,480 --> 00:31:38,720
so show the armature a to select

863
00:31:38,720 --> 00:31:40,240
everything keyframes

864
00:31:40,240 --> 00:31:43,200
scale two oh okay apparently then select

865
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,720
all the keyframes

866
00:31:44,720 --> 00:31:49,279
scale two g move it to here

867
00:31:50,000 --> 00:31:51,679
frame one and then we have to cycle it

868
00:31:51,679 --> 00:31:53,200
on frame 32 instead

869
00:31:53,200 --> 00:31:56,480
we can see a little bit slower here

870
00:31:57,919 --> 00:31:59,760
and it's animated in place now so you

871
00:31:59,760 --> 00:32:00,880
won't really see that it's moving

872
00:32:00,880 --> 00:32:02,159
forward but it should be

873
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:03,760
possible to animate it forward at a

874
00:32:03,760 --> 00:32:05,760
steady pace i think uh or you could do

875
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:07,279
root motion and animate it into the

876
00:32:07,279 --> 00:32:07,840
spell

877
00:32:07,840 --> 00:32:11,039
i think that should be all right

878
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:12,960
but then i think i like the more rapid

879
00:32:12,960 --> 00:32:14,320
it's a bot after all it's going to be

880
00:32:14,320 --> 00:32:16,159
like in a quick game

881
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,760
so let's make it faster again 16. there

882
00:32:19,760 --> 00:32:21,600
we go i like that one more

883
00:32:21,600 --> 00:32:24,399
a bit more rapid come back next week for

884
00:32:24,399 --> 00:32:24,880
another

885
00:32:24,880 --> 00:32:26,240
episode of the 10 minute mauling

886
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,039
challenge it's going to be episode 72

887
00:32:29,039 --> 00:32:31,120
and not only that i'm going to be since

888
00:32:31,120 --> 00:32:32,720
i've had the ludum dare out of the way

889
00:32:32,720 --> 00:32:34,559
now and my wife's birthday which was

890
00:32:34,559 --> 00:32:35,120
wonderful

891
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:37,919
and it's out of the way but that's not

892
00:32:37,919 --> 00:32:38,720
what i meant to say

893
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,159
like that sounds weird it sounds like i

894
00:32:40,159 --> 00:32:41,440
didn't enjoy it but it was really nice

895
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:44,000
actually we had a really good time

896
00:32:44,000 --> 00:32:46,480
weirdo okay i'm taking myself a little

897
00:32:46,480 --> 00:32:47,039
bit

898
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:50,159
of a pity so uh ludum dares out of the

899
00:32:50,159 --> 00:32:50,640
way

900
00:32:50,640 --> 00:32:55,679
um no matter how i put it it sounds like

901
00:32:55,679 --> 00:32:57,840
like out of the way now that the ludum

902
00:32:57,840 --> 00:32:59,120
dare is out of the way and

903
00:32:59,120 --> 00:33:00,720
we've had birthdays we're doing a little

904
00:33:00,720 --> 00:33:02,320
bit to the house and everything but

905
00:33:02,320 --> 00:33:04,000
now it's uh i should have some time now

906
00:33:04,000 --> 00:33:05,360
to do the rest of those

907
00:33:05,360 --> 00:33:07,279
narration uh segments with the little

908
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:09,279
wild west game the gunfighter thing

909
00:33:09,279 --> 00:33:11,039
so that should be a little bit fun keep

910
00:33:11,039 --> 00:33:13,120
