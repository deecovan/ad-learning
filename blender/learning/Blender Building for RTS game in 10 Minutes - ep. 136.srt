00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,040
hello everyone and welcome to episode

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:04,759
136 of the 10-minute modeling challenge

3
00:00:04,759 --> 00:00:06,000
this week we're going to be switching

4
00:00:06,000 --> 00:00:08,000
from one game to another I'm going to go

5
00:00:08,000 --> 00:00:09,679
from unfair Rampage we were doing a

6
00:00:09,679 --> 00:00:11,200
windmill there last week and I'm going

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:13,639
to switch over to the RTS game line war

8
00:00:13,639 --> 00:00:15,400
and create a new building there because

9
00:00:15,400 --> 00:00:18,240
we're needing we we need we need an

10
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:20,039
academy there a lot of stuff has been

11
00:00:20,039 --> 00:00:21,640
happening to the game not only did

12
00:00:21,640 --> 00:00:23,840
single player come woo everyone can play

13
00:00:23,840 --> 00:00:26,080
it now even the people without friends I

14
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:28,000
nearly said shouldn't say that but

15
00:00:28,000 --> 00:00:29,599
people that can't find someone to play

16
00:00:29,599 --> 00:00:31,519
against on internet they can actually

17
00:00:31,519 --> 00:00:33,160
play against an AI now that's pretty

18
00:00:33,160 --> 00:00:36,160
cool so uh we need um now we're working

19
00:00:36,160 --> 00:00:38,320
on Technologies and we're be adding a

20
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,879
lot of the stuff for example let's have

21
00:00:39,879 --> 00:00:42,079
a look at the screen here because uh if

22
00:00:42,079 --> 00:00:44,920
I unpa this what I've been working on

23
00:00:44,920 --> 00:00:47,440
today and yesterday is camouflage stuff

24
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,120
so we have something called Pioneer

25
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:53,239
units now or Pioneer troops Pioneer core

26
00:00:53,239 --> 00:00:55,600
and if I spawn a few of them here I'm in

27
00:00:55,600 --> 00:00:57,000
like a sandbox mode we can make it a

28
00:00:57,000 --> 00:00:59,399
little bit bigger and we let's make sure

29
00:00:59,399 --> 00:01:00,440
actually we'll go over here where

30
00:01:00,440 --> 00:01:02,559
there's a bit of uh desert there's some

31
00:01:02,559 --> 00:01:06,400
mountains some forest and some grass and

32
00:01:06,400 --> 00:01:08,159
check out if I spawn a few units here

33
00:01:08,159 --> 00:01:09,479
see that they've got like an orange

34
00:01:09,479 --> 00:01:12,119
backpack on and that's because these are

35
00:01:12,119 --> 00:01:14,439
the Pioneer core and they can entrench

36
00:01:14,439 --> 00:01:16,920
faster and they can camouflage their uh

37
00:01:16,920 --> 00:01:18,360
their little hideouts or their

38
00:01:18,360 --> 00:01:20,600
entrenchments so they dig a lot faster

39
00:01:20,600 --> 00:01:22,400
they create these entrenchments and when

40
00:01:22,400 --> 00:01:24,560
they're done UPS slides a little

41
00:01:24,560 --> 00:01:26,520
camouflage net and whether this will be

42
00:01:26,520 --> 00:01:28,600
the final mesh version that's going to

43
00:01:28,600 --> 00:01:30,240
be ending up in the game not sure yet

44
00:01:30,240 --> 00:01:31,520
because I'm still working on these

45
00:01:31,520 --> 00:01:34,280
things but there's here's the latest

46
00:01:34,280 --> 00:01:35,880
installment of them and you can see as

47
00:01:35,880 --> 00:01:38,759
well that it Shi shifts over to desert

48
00:01:38,759 --> 00:01:40,520
camo here where there's desert and then

49
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:42,320
there's a mountain camo and then some

50
00:01:42,320 --> 00:01:43,920
Plains and in the forest they'll have

51
00:01:43,920 --> 00:01:45,240
that as well and it's a bit of a

52
00:01:45,240 --> 00:01:46,719
challenge because you need to be able to

53
00:01:46,719 --> 00:01:48,399
make sure that you can see the units

54
00:01:48,399 --> 00:01:51,000
good enough so I've had to if I go into

55
00:01:51,000 --> 00:01:52,719
like this little scene view here you can

56
00:01:52,719 --> 00:01:54,680
see I've had to make a little hole in

57
00:01:54,680 --> 00:01:56,600
the top and there's like a little mesh

58
00:01:56,600 --> 00:01:59,000
and it sways quite a bit and that's on

59
00:01:59,000 --> 00:02:00,960
intention at the as well because then

60
00:02:00,960 --> 00:02:02,719
actually it reveals the unit below it a

61
00:02:02,719 --> 00:02:04,880
little bit and it's only the foot

62
00:02:04,880 --> 00:02:07,200
soldiers here that can dig these but if

63
00:02:07,200 --> 00:02:10,440
I spawn like um let's see a couple of uh

64
00:02:10,440 --> 00:02:12,680
artillery pieces here then they can

65
00:02:12,680 --> 00:02:15,239
actually go into and let's say switch

66
00:02:15,239 --> 00:02:18,080
off the entrenchments for these so the

67
00:02:18,080 --> 00:02:20,280
uh once the Pioneer core here has been

68
00:02:20,280 --> 00:02:22,760
digging some uh some secure and high

69
00:02:22,760 --> 00:02:25,080
hidden entrenchments then other units

70
00:02:25,080 --> 00:02:26,920
can go to those and it's a bit ironic

71
00:02:26,920 --> 00:02:28,800
now that they actually decided to go to

72
00:02:28,800 --> 00:02:30,400
slots where there wasn't any

73
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:33,160
entrenchments but if I spawn a few more

74
00:02:33,160 --> 00:02:35,040
uh like here you can see that they'll be

75
00:02:35,040 --> 00:02:37,760
able to and a tank why not as well H

76
00:02:37,760 --> 00:02:40,120
they'll be able to dig dig down and they

77
00:02:40,120 --> 00:02:41,440
don't need to dig down because they have

78
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:43,360
already being created the Pioneer core

79
00:02:43,360 --> 00:02:44,560
here has already created these but

80
00:02:44,560 --> 00:02:46,599
they'll how hide out here so with these

81
00:02:46,599 --> 00:02:48,560
little dig outs that are entrenched and

82
00:02:48,560 --> 00:02:50,319
hidden away with some camouflage it'll

83
00:02:50,319 --> 00:02:52,080
be a lot more difficult for the enemy to

84
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:54,080
detect those so you'll do a landfall

85
00:02:54,080 --> 00:02:55,800
somewhere and you go woo this looks nice

86
00:02:55,800 --> 00:02:57,159
and empty but it's not it's full of

87
00:02:57,159 --> 00:02:58,800
people there so let's switch over to

88
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,159
today's topic and I'm I'm going to be

89
00:03:00,159 --> 00:03:02,280
creating an academy building so it needs

90
00:03:02,280 --> 00:03:04,360
to be a little bit high-tech looking but

91
00:03:04,360 --> 00:03:05,799
not too high-tech it's going to be low

92
00:03:05,799 --> 00:03:08,840
poly and it has to fit the Aesthetics of

93
00:03:08,840 --> 00:03:10,080
line War as well so it's going to be

94
00:03:10,080 --> 00:03:12,239
very similar and uh I'm going to be

95
00:03:12,239 --> 00:03:14,120
probably I've got um a scene here where

96
00:03:14,120 --> 00:03:15,400
I've got all my buildings and I've

97
00:03:15,400 --> 00:03:17,480
enabled uh here's the factory in the

98
00:03:17,480 --> 00:03:20,480
game and here's the town and I also have

99
00:03:20,480 --> 00:03:22,319
the here's actually I'm working on some

100
00:03:22,319 --> 00:03:26,080
camouflage for the barracks here and uh

101
00:03:26,080 --> 00:03:27,760
the so I'm going to be creating one new

102
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:30,239
building here today and with War we're

103
00:03:30,239 --> 00:03:31,400
actually using we're not using the

104
00:03:31,400 --> 00:03:33,319
infancia Pix pile palette because um

105
00:03:33,319 --> 00:03:35,519
this game was starting to be designed

106
00:03:35,519 --> 00:03:37,439
way before I created that more advanced

107
00:03:37,439 --> 00:03:39,080
pix pile palette so I'm using a very

108
00:03:39,080 --> 00:03:41,200
basic one here with just the basic

109
00:03:41,200 --> 00:03:42,879
colors which is pretty good as well

110
00:03:42,879 --> 00:03:45,200
because then I stick to a specific color

111
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:47,519
pattern for everything in the game and

112
00:03:47,519 --> 00:03:49,120
uh the only thing that actually shifts a

113
00:03:49,120 --> 00:03:50,879
little bit is these two colors here

114
00:03:50,879 --> 00:03:53,120
they're uh these two blue colors here

115
00:03:53,120 --> 00:03:54,959
they'll actually be redesigned for up to

116
00:03:54,959 --> 00:03:56,280
eight different units they'll be like

117
00:03:56,280 --> 00:04:00,159
red teal purple black it just rotates

118
00:04:00,159 --> 00:04:01,879
with different colors so the only colors

119
00:04:01,879 --> 00:04:03,480
I've got to play around with are these

120
00:04:03,480 --> 00:04:04,959
at the moment and then I have to accent

121
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:07,319
it with these two colors so uh that will

122
00:04:07,319 --> 00:04:08,799
shift in the game so when you come to

123
00:04:08,799 --> 00:04:10,400
the building and it's a red building

124
00:04:10,400 --> 00:04:12,959
then uh these two colors will be shifted

125
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,920
so that's why actually I think I've got

126
00:04:14,920 --> 00:04:17,560
uh some sample materials here we can

127
00:04:17,560 --> 00:04:18,798
probably

128
00:04:18,798 --> 00:04:23,120
look all of them are copies of that one

129
00:04:23,120 --> 00:04:24,720
okay never mind I didn't have any red

130
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:27,720
one never mind so let's get started I'm

131
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,199
going to put 10 minutes on the clock and

132
00:04:29,199 --> 00:04:31,000
then I'm going to be be trying to create

133
00:04:31,000 --> 00:04:33,440
uh this Academy building for line war

134
00:04:33,440 --> 00:04:35,160
and again this will probably be a

135
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,520
prototype I'll probably have to do a lot

136
00:04:36,520 --> 00:04:37,880
of testing and it's going to be a

137
00:04:37,880 --> 00:04:39,680
modular building but at least I'll be

138
00:04:39,680 --> 00:04:41,520
able to get a prototype together that's

139
00:04:41,520 --> 00:04:44,000
the purpose of today's video tomorrow as

140
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,039
well I'm going to be driving up to uh a

141
00:04:46,039 --> 00:04:48,120
college in uh on the Sunshine Coast

142
00:04:48,120 --> 00:04:49,560
that's going to be a lot of fun cuz uh

143
00:04:49,560 --> 00:04:51,280
I've got eight new students there that

144
00:04:51,280 --> 00:04:52,880
are going to be learning some blender

145
00:04:52,880 --> 00:04:54,880
skills so I'm going to be showing them

146
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,880
probably low poly character uh modeling

147
00:04:56,880 --> 00:04:58,680
like I did last year so that's going to

148
00:04:58,680 --> 00:05:00,039
be a lot of fun going to be head up

149
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:01,720
there and uh actually in fact if you're

150
00:05:01,720 --> 00:05:03,479
watching the premiere now right when

151
00:05:03,479 --> 00:05:04,759
this Premiere is done I'm going to jump

152
00:05:04,759 --> 00:05:06,320
in the car and drive up there and give

153
00:05:06,320 --> 00:05:09,120
him a bit of a a a lesson I'm going to

154
00:05:09,120 --> 00:05:11,600
teach him a lesson sounds weird I not

155
00:05:11,600 --> 00:05:13,360
going to tell them off but I'm not all

156
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,280
right let's put uh some time on the

157
00:05:15,280 --> 00:05:19,400
clock here ready steady go and off yep

158
00:05:19,400 --> 00:05:22,039
it's counting down so T ined mode select

159
00:05:22,039 --> 00:05:24,960
this shave sh face hold the control key

160
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:26,319
snap it down to there shift e to

161
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:29,680
duplicate it scale it down let's make a

162
00:05:29,680 --> 00:05:31,759
ilar style here I can probably keep it

163
00:05:31,759 --> 00:05:33,960
to that style e to extrude and then

164
00:05:33,960 --> 00:05:36,720
shift e to duplicate move it over here e

165
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:38,280
to extrude I'm going to do some

166
00:05:38,280 --> 00:05:41,520
different floors so I'll probably do

167
00:05:41,520 --> 00:05:44,160
like this and then Shifty to duplicate

168
00:05:44,160 --> 00:05:46,840
that on scale it down move it here just

169
00:05:46,840 --> 00:05:49,639
needs to be looking a little bit nice

170
00:05:49,639 --> 00:05:51,720
like something and then Shifty to

171
00:05:51,720 --> 00:05:54,199
duplicate and I think one here as well

172
00:05:54,199 --> 00:05:55,960
there we go so that's the going to be

173
00:05:55,960 --> 00:05:58,360
the foundation here I want to do it

174
00:05:58,360 --> 00:06:01,319
inser and scale it down a bit more e to

175
00:06:01,319 --> 00:06:03,800
extrude and let's create some staircase

176
00:06:03,800 --> 00:06:06,120
here so shift e to duplicate this one

177
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:09,680
scale on the x-axis move it into here

178
00:06:09,680 --> 00:06:11,360
and I don't know I need to find a better

179
00:06:11,360 --> 00:06:13,319
way to do stairs but what I tend to do

180
00:06:13,319 --> 00:06:17,240
is um like this I'll uh control R Loop

181
00:06:17,240 --> 00:06:20,560
cut that on maybe to there and then here

182
00:06:20,560 --> 00:06:22,520
is the unfortunately the fastest way

183
00:06:22,520 --> 00:06:24,240
actually I'll hide that face shift

184
00:06:24,240 --> 00:06:27,000
select oh oh it's no no no l select the

185
00:06:27,000 --> 00:06:30,240
link e to extrude and there we go

186
00:06:30,240 --> 00:06:31,800
and I need to find how much I'm actually

187
00:06:31,800 --> 00:06:34,120
extruding e to extrude 0.1 no that's too

188
00:06:34,120 --> 00:06:34,919
much

189
00:06:34,919 --> 00:06:39,599
0.05 e to extrude 0.05 that's it and

190
00:06:39,599 --> 00:06:42,360
then here we go e to extrude

191
00:06:42,360 --> 00:06:46,000
0.05 shift select that one e

192
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:51,639
0.05 and shift select that on E 0.05 and

193
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:52,639
that's going to be enough actually I

194
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:56,000
don't need all of these other ones so I

195
00:06:56,000 --> 00:06:59,080
just do alt select on that on delete

196
00:06:59,080 --> 00:07:00,560
faces

197
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,160
and we'll cap this as well alt select

198
00:07:03,160 --> 00:07:04,319
there F

199
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:07,160
to L select the link and move it into

200
00:07:07,160 --> 00:07:09,479
there and then move it down so I just

201
00:07:09,479 --> 00:07:13,800
needed some U stairs there and should

202
00:07:13,800 --> 00:07:16,160
that be a little bit higher yeah I'll

203
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,520
actually do El select the link scale on

204
00:07:18,520 --> 00:07:21,479
the Zed AIS bring it up to here and ALT

205
00:07:21,479 --> 00:07:24,080
H I need to un unhide that face again

206
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,360
and then actually I'm going to scale

207
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,720
them I want them a little bit longer

208
00:07:26,720 --> 00:07:29,520
instead then how about this that should

209
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:32,319
should do and uh here as well I'm going

210
00:07:32,319 --> 00:07:34,759
to do these like multistory I think uh

211
00:07:34,759 --> 00:07:36,800
so I can combine different modules I

212
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,759
think that should be good uh so what

213
00:07:38,759 --> 00:07:42,120
I'll do here is I'll do I to inser and E

214
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,879
to extrude and then we'll do control R

215
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:47,039
and then create some windows here

216
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:48,759
control R here as

217
00:07:48,759 --> 00:07:52,520
well and it inset and I'll do it twice

218
00:07:52,520 --> 00:07:55,319
so I get individual e to extrude that on

219
00:07:55,319 --> 00:07:56,919
and that should be all right we'll do

220
00:07:56,919 --> 00:07:59,000
the like dark Windows there as well so I

221
00:07:59,000 --> 00:08:00,639
need to put the accents on as well so

222
00:08:00,639 --> 00:08:02,080
we'll be able to differentiate these

223
00:08:02,080 --> 00:08:03,560
building and usually I do that on the

224
00:08:03,560 --> 00:08:04,879
corners and stuff so I'm going to do

225
00:08:04,879 --> 00:08:06,759
shift d to duplicate that on scale it

226
00:08:06,759 --> 00:08:09,759
down bring it in there and then scale it

227
00:08:09,759 --> 00:08:11,800
down again and bringing that down to

228
00:08:11,800 --> 00:08:13,319
there and then let's just put the accent

229
00:08:13,319 --> 00:08:15,639
here so e to extrude hold the control

230
00:08:15,639 --> 00:08:17,560
key okay I need to actually switch this

231
00:08:17,560 --> 00:08:19,759
one to vertex so I can hold the control

232
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:21,800
key slide it up on the blue axis hold

233
00:08:21,800 --> 00:08:23,759
the control key snap it to there I'll

234
00:08:23,759 --> 00:08:25,080
select the link and now we'll pick the

235
00:08:25,080 --> 00:08:26,919
blue color there so we can I don't mind

236
00:08:26,919 --> 00:08:28,319
that it's Z fighting there cuz I'm going

237
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:31,240
to be uh fixing those a little bit later

238
00:08:31,240 --> 00:08:34,479
on and overlapping them so and here also

239
00:08:34,479 --> 00:08:35,799
another thing that I like to do on these

240
00:08:35,799 --> 00:08:38,159
buildings is uh just create a beveled

241
00:08:38,159 --> 00:08:41,120
edge here think either once or twice

242
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:44,279
like that and then we'll do all El

243
00:08:44,279 --> 00:08:46,640
select the link

244
00:08:46,640 --> 00:08:49,720
and I think uh yeah Shifty to duplicate

245
00:08:49,720 --> 00:08:51,839
that on and we'll put the same sort of

246
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:55,040
pillar here as well and move that one to

247
00:08:55,040 --> 00:08:58,959
here bring it up to here and grab the

248
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,839
bottom one there there and pull it down

249
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,279
oh need to pull the whole face down

250
00:09:04,279 --> 00:09:05,640
there you

251
00:09:05,640 --> 00:09:08,760
go and El select the L and then I think

252
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,519
I'm going to be doing just Shifty to

253
00:09:10,519 --> 00:09:12,839
duplicate that one and put one there as

254
00:09:12,839 --> 00:09:17,040
well I should do so and uh here should

255
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:20,079
we do another platform I think so I'll

256
00:09:20,079 --> 00:09:23,279
do e to extrude this one move it into

257
00:09:23,279 --> 00:09:26,399
here and we need to do the multi story

258
00:09:26,399 --> 00:09:29,040
now so maybe I'll do blue in here as

259
00:09:29,040 --> 00:09:30,399
well

260
00:09:30,399 --> 00:09:33,880
and here e to extrude I just need

261
00:09:33,880 --> 00:09:35,880
accents because you be able you have to

262
00:09:35,880 --> 00:09:37,720
be able to see who who this building

263
00:09:37,720 --> 00:09:40,519
belongs to uh actually I'm going to be

264
00:09:40,519 --> 00:09:42,120
duplicating this instead of shift e to

265
00:09:42,120 --> 00:09:45,040
duplicate it scale on the Y AIS e to

266
00:09:45,040 --> 00:09:47,839
extrude and then select these two edges

267
00:09:47,839 --> 00:09:50,320
contrl B to Bevel them El select the

268
00:09:50,320 --> 00:09:52,760
linked and grab that on

269
00:09:52,760 --> 00:09:54,959
there and then now I'm going to do

270
00:09:54,959 --> 00:09:57,120
another floor here so Shifty to

271
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,959
duplicate that on and maybe rotate Zed

272
00:09:59,959 --> 00:10:02,839
90 okay I need to not be an individual

273
00:10:02,839 --> 00:10:08,279
period medium Point rotate Zed at

274
00:10:08,360 --> 00:10:10,279
90°

275
00:10:10,279 --> 00:10:14,399
and that looks a bit uh funky but okay

276
00:10:14,399 --> 00:10:16,720
let move it into there and slide it into

277
00:10:16,720 --> 00:10:18,200
here as

278
00:10:18,200 --> 00:10:20,360
well I think I'm going to scale this one

279
00:10:20,360 --> 00:10:22,680
up a little bit it's going to be a

280
00:10:22,680 --> 00:10:24,600
bigger floor here for some reason so

281
00:10:24,600 --> 00:10:27,040
there we go and we need to do some how

282
00:10:27,040 --> 00:10:29,120
am I doing 451 okay so it doesn't make

283
00:10:29,120 --> 00:10:31,920
much sense yet but trust me it won't in

284
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:34,680
the end either probably I need to

285
00:10:34,680 --> 00:10:36,920
probably have something more here as

286
00:10:36,920 --> 00:10:40,440
well so I'll e to extrude this one and I

287
00:10:40,440 --> 00:10:41,959
have to check make sure that I don't

288
00:10:41,959 --> 00:10:45,040
have back faces as well later on so this

289
00:10:45,040 --> 00:10:46,839
is going to be our Academy I I guess we

290
00:10:46,839 --> 00:10:49,519
should put some so like solar panels on

291
00:10:49,519 --> 00:10:51,399
and I think I want to make it okay it's

292
00:10:51,399 --> 00:10:53,200
quite a bit taller than that one now

293
00:10:53,200 --> 00:10:55,560
that's fine I don't think I'll be able

294
00:10:55,560 --> 00:10:59,399
to do it modular enough to to have um uh

295
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:00,959
all different things for all the

296
00:11:00,959 --> 00:11:02,480
different Tech I actually had the idea

297
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:03,959
first that it'd be kind of cool to do

298
00:11:03,959 --> 00:11:05,560
that so every different Tech would have

299
00:11:05,560 --> 00:11:07,079
its own floor in the building so you

300
00:11:07,079 --> 00:11:08,800
could see but I'll probably have to

301
00:11:08,800 --> 00:11:11,600
differentiate that in a different way so

302
00:11:11,600 --> 00:11:13,600
I'll do control R here as well e to

303
00:11:13,600 --> 00:11:17,360
extrude this one and uh here could be

304
00:11:17,360 --> 00:11:19,079
another entrance maybe a different type

305
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:22,680
of or a ramp maybe on this one control R

306
00:11:22,680 --> 00:11:25,000
it to

307
00:11:25,000 --> 00:11:28,760
inset and move it up e to extrude it and

308
00:11:28,760 --> 00:11:30,560
then here

309
00:11:30,560 --> 00:11:32,839
shift e to duplicate this one scale I

310
00:11:32,839 --> 00:11:34,440
don't really mind about overlapping

311
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:37,560
geometry either scale y e to extrude El

312
00:11:37,560 --> 00:11:40,440
select the link down and it's just about

313
00:11:40,440 --> 00:11:43,600
creating interesting shapes so there's

314
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,680
like a a ramp of some sort that's fine

315
00:11:46,680 --> 00:11:50,040
and more accents I think so Shifty to

316
00:11:50,040 --> 00:11:53,360
duplicate we'll put accents

317
00:11:53,360 --> 00:11:58,839
here uh rotate Z 180 oh rotate Z 180 and

318
00:11:58,839 --> 00:12:00,480
then move it it down and it's important

319
00:12:00,480 --> 00:12:01,839
as well that the building goes down in

320
00:12:01,839 --> 00:12:03,240
the ground because sometimes you build

321
00:12:03,240 --> 00:12:05,320
it on a slope so this needs to actually

322
00:12:05,320 --> 00:12:07,040
keep going down like a foundation like

323
00:12:07,040 --> 00:12:10,000
that that's pretty good and uh here I

324
00:12:10,000 --> 00:12:11,680
think I'm going to put uh I'm not going

325
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:13,720
to put another floor on it but I'll do I

326
00:12:13,720 --> 00:12:16,600
to inser twice so I don't get individual

327
00:12:16,600 --> 00:12:18,760
e to extrude this one down and then I'm

328
00:12:18,760 --> 00:12:20,440
going to put like some sort of a solar

329
00:12:20,440 --> 00:12:24,519
panels up here so scale scale Z zero

330
00:12:24,519 --> 00:12:27,839
that's fine e to extrude and shift e to

331
00:12:27,839 --> 00:12:29,519
duplicate

332
00:12:29,519 --> 00:12:32,199
and here let's just bring these up these

333
00:12:32,199 --> 00:12:34,040
are going to be some solar array type of

334
00:12:34,040 --> 00:12:36,360
panels so let's make them black looks

335
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:39,079
high-tech and then we'll do e to extrude

336
00:12:39,079 --> 00:12:40,880
that on and then we'll just put some

337
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,760
Foundation here shift e to duplicate

338
00:12:42,760 --> 00:12:45,959
scale it down e to extrude so it goes

339
00:12:45,959 --> 00:12:48,279
into there bring this one up to here as

340
00:12:48,279 --> 00:12:50,279
well control r a few times make it a

341
00:12:50,279 --> 00:12:52,120
little bit high-tech looking don't know

342
00:12:52,120 --> 00:12:53,920
why this would make it high tech looking

343
00:12:53,920 --> 00:12:56,079
but actually I'm going to control r a

344
00:12:56,079 --> 00:12:59,240
little bit more control R how many five

345
00:12:59,240 --> 00:13:03,880
six oh okay not 56 control R 6 how about

346
00:13:03,880 --> 00:13:07,560
that and then it to

347
00:13:09,279 --> 00:13:11,880
inser okay that didn't work either I

348
00:13:11,880 --> 00:13:13,959
insert why is it oh I have to hold the

349
00:13:13,959 --> 00:13:18,880
control key or something shift alt ah

350
00:13:18,880 --> 00:13:22,079
okay period have I got different is my

351
00:13:22,079 --> 00:13:24,320
scale off here or

352
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,040
something scale's fine no okay I'm not

353
00:13:27,040 --> 00:13:30,760
sure why it's uh I set it's really wonky

354
00:13:30,760 --> 00:13:32,399
finding those there okay I'll just do a

355
00:13:32,399 --> 00:13:34,600
little bit and ALT the

356
00:13:34,600 --> 00:13:37,880
scale okay never mind got of a funky

357
00:13:37,880 --> 00:13:39,600
look no I'm not not going to have that

358
00:13:39,600 --> 00:13:42,480
so let's just contrl Z out of

359
00:13:42,480 --> 00:13:46,440
day and scale to select okay we'll do it

360
00:13:46,440 --> 00:13:49,120
like that instead then and then we'll do

361
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:51,320
shift e to duplicate that on move it in

362
00:13:51,320 --> 00:13:54,440
E to extrude scale it down and bring

363
00:13:54,440 --> 00:13:57,120
that down that makes sense or something

364
00:13:57,120 --> 00:13:59,560
l l l and

365
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:01,959
scale that one up a little bit and then

366
00:14:01,959 --> 00:14:04,600
shift e to duplicate on the x-axis to

367
00:14:04,600 --> 00:14:07,639
there and then shift R that's our little

368
00:14:07,639 --> 00:14:10,560
academy thing going there and here I

369
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,800
think I want to create the platform as

370
00:14:11,800 --> 00:14:13,199
well I only have one minute to go so

371
00:14:13,199 --> 00:14:14,759
Shifty to duplicate that we're going to

372
00:14:14,759 --> 00:14:16,480
test in in the game as well to see what

373
00:14:16,480 --> 00:14:18,480
it looks like what needs changing think

374
00:14:18,480 --> 00:14:20,360
I want to do e to extrude and I think

375
00:14:20,360 --> 00:14:22,160
I'm going to put some pillars here make

376
00:14:22,160 --> 00:14:23,680
a little bit more interesting looking e

377
00:14:23,680 --> 00:14:24,720
to

378
00:14:24,720 --> 00:14:27,600
extrude and El select the link move it

379
00:14:27,600 --> 00:14:31,000
to there shift e duplicate on the X or

380
00:14:31,000 --> 00:14:33,800
on the Y AIS maybe to

381
00:14:33,800 --> 00:14:35,320
there

382
00:14:35,320 --> 00:14:37,680
and this platform I want it to be

383
00:14:37,680 --> 00:14:40,560
connected to here and this one looks a

384
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:41,800
bit empty so I'm actually going to

385
00:14:41,800 --> 00:14:44,279
double this one move it in a little bit

386
00:14:44,279 --> 00:14:48,000
Shifty duplicate that one scale Zed and

387
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,639
move that

388
00:14:49,639 --> 00:14:54,720
in and then here we'll do let's see what

389
00:14:54,720 --> 00:14:56,240
do I have on the other other buildings

390
00:14:56,240 --> 00:14:57,920
I've got some Slants and chimneys and

391
00:14:57,920 --> 00:15:00,079
stuff this one's not going to have Chim

392
00:15:00,079 --> 00:15:01,079
e to

393
00:15:01,079 --> 00:15:03,600
extrude and let's just accent this whole

394
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:07,560
thing we need more accents here and

395
00:15:07,560 --> 00:15:10,000
shift select these darker in here I

396
00:15:10,000 --> 00:15:11,360
usually do that like an ambient

397
00:15:11,360 --> 00:15:15,240
occlusion thing fake one yeah there here

398
00:15:15,240 --> 00:15:18,399
as well alt select on the edge darker

399
00:15:18,399 --> 00:15:22,120
and then slant this one and 's

400
00:15:24,120 --> 00:15:29,680
up okay so pretty plain looking and

401
00:15:29,680 --> 00:15:31,160
just playing around a little bit with

402
00:15:31,160 --> 00:15:32,880
shapes to see what it looks like so I'm

403
00:15:32,880 --> 00:15:35,880
going to do Academy let's name it and

404
00:15:35,880 --> 00:15:37,279
let's export it into the game just to

405
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,160
see what it looks like I'm going to go

406
00:15:39,160 --> 00:15:42,839
file export fpx and selected objects

407
00:15:42,839 --> 00:15:44,560
we'll do apply transform for this one

408
00:15:44,560 --> 00:15:47,240
apply scalings unit scale go to the mesh

409
00:15:47,240 --> 00:15:50,079
folder and then just call it Academy

410
00:15:50,079 --> 00:15:51,720
then I also need to make fractured

411
00:15:51,720 --> 00:15:53,600
version of these and when they're

412
00:15:53,600 --> 00:15:56,839
broken that should be fine and what I'm

413
00:15:56,839 --> 00:15:58,440
going to do is I'm going to put this

414
00:15:58,440 --> 00:16:00,480
building I think

415
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:03,639
on a different object so cuz oh no we

416
00:16:03,639 --> 00:16:05,600
actually have the academy so let's uh

417
00:16:05,600 --> 00:16:07,199
let's try

418
00:16:07,199 --> 00:16:10,800
that so in the game here

419
00:16:10,800 --> 00:16:14,399
Academy I can type here we go cuz uh

420
00:16:14,399 --> 00:16:16,399
bantos has already created a placeholder

421
00:16:16,399 --> 00:16:18,639
for this which is kind of great uh so

422
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,920
instead of the town here I'm going to

423
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:21,959
switch this town building

424
00:16:21,959 --> 00:16:24,199
to and we should already have this

425
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:26,240
Academy in here now yeah cuz I exported

426
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,720
it into the folder structure let's look

427
00:16:27,720 --> 00:16:29,240
in here and we're going to going to take

428
00:16:29,240 --> 00:16:30,959
away this giant cylinder here cuz this

429
00:16:30,959 --> 00:16:34,519
was a bantos Academy hint can take this

430
00:16:34,519 --> 00:16:36,560
one away now cuz he had to differentiate

431
00:16:36,560 --> 00:16:39,319
that building just so we're going to try

432
00:16:39,319 --> 00:16:41,680
that and now let's go in the game and

433
00:16:41,680 --> 00:16:45,160
have a look at it it's already ready to

434
00:16:45,160 --> 00:16:49,399
go but it's called town here but that's

435
00:16:49,399 --> 00:16:54,880
okay and let us

436
00:16:56,480 --> 00:16:59,319
play and it needs to be built close to a

437
00:16:59,319 --> 00:17:03,680
town or a city so here's a town

438
00:17:04,679 --> 00:17:07,679
spot take we'll take these

439
00:17:07,679 --> 00:17:10,720
territories and build a town and then we

440
00:17:10,720 --> 00:17:12,199
can build the

441
00:17:12,199 --> 00:17:16,039
academy wrong there but that's fine okay

442
00:17:16,039 --> 00:17:17,720
so we see a few issues here straight

443
00:17:17,720 --> 00:17:19,839
away we have the Zed fighting cuz I've

444
00:17:19,839 --> 00:17:21,839
got the platform right on the base here

445
00:17:21,839 --> 00:17:22,919
so I'm probably going to take that

446
00:17:22,919 --> 00:17:25,400
platform

447
00:17:25,760 --> 00:17:29,840
away uh and also it's two planes to gray

448
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,720
so I need to add a few things maybe

449
00:17:31,720 --> 00:17:33,360
we'll zoom in a little bit and we can

450
00:17:33,360 --> 00:17:34,799
update this on the fight I'll just pause

451
00:17:34,799 --> 00:17:37,640
the game now and move it in here and I

452
00:17:37,640 --> 00:17:39,200
think what I'm going to do is I'm going

453
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:42,400
to El select the link or eight select

454
00:17:42,400 --> 00:17:43,600
everything I'm going to move it down a

455
00:17:43,600 --> 00:17:46,240
little bit so it's under the

456
00:17:46,240 --> 00:17:49,240
ground instead and I'm going to keep the

457
00:17:49,240 --> 00:17:50,720
foundation cuz if we're building in the

458
00:17:50,720 --> 00:17:52,200
mountains it's important to be able to

459
00:17:52,200 --> 00:17:55,400
have like a foundation for the building

460
00:17:55,400 --> 00:17:57,880
so let's keep but I'll lower this down

461
00:17:57,880 --> 00:17:59,840
slightly as well

462
00:17:59,840 --> 00:18:01,640
but we can't have these things flying in

463
00:18:01,640 --> 00:18:02,960
the

464
00:18:02,960 --> 00:18:05,919
air let's move this one down to here I

465
00:18:05,919 --> 00:18:07,720
think this will be it's just so we don't

466
00:18:07,720 --> 00:18:09,480
have anything running exactly on the

467
00:18:09,480 --> 00:18:11,320
same plane as the ground that's the

468
00:18:11,320 --> 00:18:12,960
important thing and then another thing

469
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:15,799
we noticed was that it was too two

470
00:18:15,799 --> 00:18:17,320
static looking so I'm going to alt

471
00:18:17,320 --> 00:18:20,400
select on this Edge I to inser alt s to

472
00:18:20,400 --> 00:18:24,520
scale and let's scale that one down and

473
00:18:24,520 --> 00:18:27,159
create

474
00:18:27,159 --> 00:18:30,280
okay that's fine I had something go in

475
00:18:30,280 --> 00:18:32,440
there but let's just change this one to

476
00:18:32,440 --> 00:18:34,520
scale

477
00:18:34,520 --> 00:18:39,159
zero and then go black there as well see

478
00:18:39,159 --> 00:18:41,320
okay we've got some broken stuff here

479
00:18:41,320 --> 00:18:43,799
all right that's why so I just need to

480
00:18:43,799 --> 00:18:45,760
do here then instead I'll go here and

481
00:18:45,760 --> 00:18:49,559
click control to their I to inser alt e

482
00:18:49,559 --> 00:18:51,760
to extrude long face normals hold the

483
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,840
ALT key so we can actually get the right

484
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,080
proportions it's a little bit difficult

485
00:18:55,080 --> 00:18:57,360
to see but sometimes it doesn't

486
00:18:57,360 --> 00:19:00,080
uniformly insert insert them move this

487
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:01,120
one

488
00:19:01,120 --> 00:19:04,679
in and this one in here as well and then

489
00:19:04,679 --> 00:19:07,440
select these and go pretty black there

490
00:19:07,440 --> 00:19:11,080
as well and then move this one down move

491
00:19:11,080 --> 00:19:13,480
this one

492
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:16,240
up okay what else this looks way too

493
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:21,000
plain so we need to create contrl R

494
00:19:21,000 --> 00:19:24,520
to more interesting looking shapes maybe

495
00:19:24,520 --> 00:19:29,080
we'll do like this it inser

496
00:19:29,080 --> 00:19:32,080
and ald to extrude along face

497
00:19:32,080 --> 00:19:35,280
normals these could be some research

498
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:36,919
like they need skylights or something

499
00:19:36,919 --> 00:19:42,039
here so it to inset Al to EXT long face

500
00:19:42,039 --> 00:19:45,400
normals it to inset alt e to extrude

501
00:19:45,400 --> 00:19:47,600
long face normals these are all

502
00:19:47,600 --> 00:19:50,320
different sizes now that's not so good

503
00:19:50,320 --> 00:19:52,240
so let's do that shift e to duplicate it

504
00:19:52,240 --> 00:19:55,320
e to extrude it let's do it once it to

505
00:19:55,320 --> 00:19:57,960
ins set e to extrude hold the ALT key so

506
00:19:57,960 --> 00:19:59,799
that make any difference

507
00:19:59,799 --> 00:20:02,440
no and I'll select the link let's get

508
00:20:02,440 --> 00:20:05,480
rid of those faces and

509
00:20:05,480 --> 00:20:08,440
then let's select those color those in

510
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:11,880
the player color control R okay what do

511
00:20:11,880 --> 00:20:14,960
we need to do El select the

512
00:20:14,960 --> 00:20:18,600
link shift e to duplicate on the y- axis

513
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,000
and then to here we'll leave a gap in

514
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,799
between as well shift R like that that

515
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,559
looks already a lot more interesting and

516
00:20:25,559 --> 00:20:27,600
maybe we can create a bay on this one

517
00:20:27,600 --> 00:20:29,320
just this one in particular

518
00:20:29,320 --> 00:20:32,760
I to inset e to extrude and then maybe

519
00:20:32,760 --> 00:20:35,919
offset this one like this and then do I

520
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:37,480
to inset and then create like a hole

521
00:20:37,480 --> 00:20:40,320
down Control Plus go dark

522
00:20:40,320 --> 00:20:43,159
there and some pipes would never be

523
00:20:43,159 --> 00:20:46,120
wrong I think this one is sticking up a

524
00:20:46,120 --> 00:20:48,120
little bit too much so let's go and I

525
00:20:48,120 --> 00:20:50,480
don't really like those foundations

526
00:20:50,480 --> 00:20:52,520
they're a little bit offset so L select

527
00:20:52,520 --> 00:20:54,679
the linked maybe we'll make it a little

528
00:20:54,679 --> 00:20:57,280
bit more just to the side there I'll

529
00:20:57,280 --> 00:20:59,200
select the link

530
00:20:59,200 --> 00:21:01,320
El select link let's delete that one

531
00:21:01,320 --> 00:21:05,000
faces control R and scale shift Zed

532
00:21:05,000 --> 00:21:06,159
because we only want to scale them on

533
00:21:06,159 --> 00:21:09,120
that axis El select the link maybe a

534
00:21:09,120 --> 00:21:11,640
darker gray and and let's look on the

535
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:15,120
side view there control 3 shift d and

536
00:21:15,120 --> 00:21:19,440
then Y and there we go two more

537
00:21:19,440 --> 00:21:22,640
interesting pillars and also these look

538
00:21:22,640 --> 00:21:24,840
two PL so I'm going to do move it down a

539
00:21:24,840 --> 00:21:28,640
little bit e to extrude S to scale it

540
00:21:28,640 --> 00:21:30,080
just to Bevel that edge a little bit

541
00:21:30,080 --> 00:21:34,039
instead I to inser and then e to extrude

542
00:21:34,039 --> 00:21:37,279
again and here this is also looking very

543
00:21:37,279 --> 00:21:39,240
un beveled so contrl B on this one

544
00:21:39,240 --> 00:21:42,400
instead scroll wheel

545
00:21:42,400 --> 00:21:46,279
there and okay that's all right and make

546
00:21:46,279 --> 00:21:49,080
the ceiling darker or the

547
00:21:49,080 --> 00:21:52,240
roof that was also more interesting here

548
00:21:52,240 --> 00:21:55,080
maybe we need a big pipe so shift e to

549
00:21:55,080 --> 00:21:57,559
duplicate move it scale it down right

550
00:21:57,559 --> 00:21:59,600
click subdivide

551
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:03,440
edit and go Circle it's my shortcut to

552
00:22:03,440 --> 00:22:06,480
create pipes I know it's stupid should

553
00:22:06,480 --> 00:22:08,919
have created a cylinder or something X

554
00:22:08,919 --> 00:22:11,480
and limited this all it's just faster to

555
00:22:11,480 --> 00:22:12,720
do that way cuz I've done it so many

556
00:22:12,720 --> 00:22:15,000
times and then we'll do I need to see

557
00:22:15,000 --> 00:22:16,640
from the side we have to hide this one

558
00:22:16,640 --> 00:22:20,880
now hide and hide oh not that one

559
00:22:20,880 --> 00:22:23,159
hide and then I like the bend the pipes

560
00:22:23,159 --> 00:22:24,559
here it makes it look a little bit more

561
00:22:24,559 --> 00:22:27,720
interesting e to extrude R to okay so

562
00:22:27,720 --> 00:22:29,559
here's a good way to to do with pipes

563
00:22:29,559 --> 00:22:32,520
actually um press one go into vertex s

564
00:22:32,520 --> 00:22:35,799
shft shift select that vertex shift s

565
00:22:35,799 --> 00:22:38,679
cursor to selected and then here I'm

566
00:22:38,679 --> 00:22:43,279
going to be moving uh just um this uh

567
00:22:43,279 --> 00:22:44,960
this is actually a shortcut I do to move

568
00:22:44,960 --> 00:22:47,200
the it's just faster to move the 3D

569
00:22:47,200 --> 00:22:49,640
cursor this way e to extrude snap it

570
00:22:49,640 --> 00:22:51,559
with the middle Mouse button to here

571
00:22:51,559 --> 00:22:53,880
select this vert shift s cursor to

572
00:22:53,880 --> 00:22:56,120
selected and then delete that vert

573
00:22:56,120 --> 00:22:57,520
that's the fastest way I've found to

574
00:22:57,520 --> 00:22:59,480
move the 3D cursor to a specific place I

575
00:22:59,480 --> 00:23:00,880
know you can go in here and like

576
00:23:00,880 --> 00:23:03,919
manually drag the 3D location but when

577
00:23:03,919 --> 00:23:05,320
you're in the flow that seems to be

578
00:23:05,320 --> 00:23:07,039
working pretty good so and then I'm

579
00:23:07,039 --> 00:23:10,039
going to use this one Spin and change it

580
00:23:10,039 --> 00:23:12,880
to the x-axis and then hold the control

581
00:23:12,880 --> 00:23:16,600
key so we snap it up to there 90° but we

582
00:23:16,600 --> 00:23:18,640
only need that's too many so I'm going

583
00:23:18,640 --> 00:23:21,760
to do like maybe just eight of them

584
00:23:21,760 --> 00:23:22,720
that's

585
00:23:22,720 --> 00:23:25,679
enough yeah I think so and then click

586
00:23:25,679 --> 00:23:27,720
here and then I'm going to shade these

587
00:23:27,720 --> 00:23:30,919
smooth so right click shade smooth on

588
00:23:30,919 --> 00:23:34,679
that pipe El select the link e to ex

589
00:23:34,679 --> 00:23:35,880
through this one

590
00:23:35,880 --> 00:23:40,200
first I'll select the link shift space g

591
00:23:40,200 --> 00:23:42,520
and I don't know in a Academy building

592
00:23:42,520 --> 00:23:43,760
why they need because it's not like an

593
00:23:43,760 --> 00:23:45,600
industry industry building so I don't

594
00:23:45,600 --> 00:23:48,320
really know why they need the these but

595
00:23:48,320 --> 00:23:49,840
I do think it'll look a little bit more

596
00:23:49,840 --> 00:23:52,520
interesting if there are some pipes here

597
00:23:52,520 --> 00:23:54,720
Shifty to and then repetition is always

598
00:23:54,720 --> 00:23:57,279
good so let's put three there and then

599
00:23:57,279 --> 00:23:59,320
make them

600
00:23:59,320 --> 00:24:01,799
like a much darker color there as well

601
00:24:01,799 --> 00:24:03,919
it's just they to research they need uh

602
00:24:03,919 --> 00:24:06,000
this I guess and then why not this could

603
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:07,360
just go through that makes it more

604
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:10,120
interesting too and I think I'm going to

605
00:24:10,120 --> 00:24:11,640
pull the other ones through as well so

606
00:24:11,640 --> 00:24:13,559
we can see them from the side here I'll

607
00:24:13,559 --> 00:24:16,600
select the link shift the snap it with

608
00:24:16,600 --> 00:24:18,120
the middle Mouse button to there and

609
00:24:18,120 --> 00:24:21,840
then shift R to repeat that

610
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:24,240
process and these look a little bit too

611
00:24:24,240 --> 00:24:25,960
plain but let's have a look in the build

612
00:24:25,960 --> 00:24:27,559
in the game to see what this looks like

613
00:24:27,559 --> 00:24:31,679
now so just select it file export

614
00:24:31,679 --> 00:24:34,679
fpx and then tab back into the game and

615
00:24:34,679 --> 00:24:37,200
there's our building so it's looking a

616
00:24:37,200 --> 00:24:39,120
little bit better I think it's too small

617
00:24:39,120 --> 00:24:40,760
I think it needs to go a little bit

618
00:24:40,760 --> 00:24:43,559
bigger so select everything and scale

619
00:24:43,559 --> 00:24:45,960
everything

620
00:24:46,159 --> 00:24:49,559
up and then make sure that it's uh let's

621
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:51,720
see it's too far in the ground now so we

622
00:24:51,720 --> 00:24:54,159
can move it up to

623
00:24:54,159 --> 00:24:57,159
here probably let's try to export this

624
00:24:57,159 --> 00:24:58,360
one and I'm going to make the f

625
00:24:58,360 --> 00:25:01,559
Foundation here darker as well like that

626
00:25:01,559 --> 00:25:03,000
not that you see that one anyway but on

627
00:25:03,000 --> 00:25:05,880
the slopes you will and let's export it

628
00:25:05,880 --> 00:25:08,200
again so that's a bit better size I

629
00:25:08,200 --> 00:25:10,720
think for that one and it looks a bit

630
00:25:10,720 --> 00:25:14,240
boring when these arrays are or like the

631
00:25:14,240 --> 00:25:16,399
solar ones are static like that so I'm

632
00:25:16,399 --> 00:25:18,880
going to rotate these a little

633
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:22,600
bit rotate set okay we need the

634
00:25:22,600 --> 00:25:25,520
foundations too I

635
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,960
think so as if if

636
00:25:29,960 --> 00:25:32,440
they're but then again that like the

637
00:25:32,440 --> 00:25:34,279
whole thing wouldn't rotate guess we'll

638
00:25:34,279 --> 00:25:36,880
put them on a like a turntable thing

639
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,640
shift e to duplicate that on right click

640
00:25:39,640 --> 00:25:44,200
subdivide and go edit Circle and scale

641
00:25:44,200 --> 00:25:47,120
it it to

642
00:25:47,120 --> 00:25:50,200
extrude there we go it makes sense if

643
00:25:50,200 --> 00:25:51,600
this whole thing

644
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,760
instead turned X and then do limited

645
00:25:54,760 --> 00:25:58,320
dissolve there Shifty to duplicate that

646
00:25:58,320 --> 00:26:01,960
on E to extrude and now we'll just l l l

647
00:26:01,960 --> 00:26:05,520
l l l select all the link

648
00:26:05,520 --> 00:26:11,679
here there we go and this one and rotate

649
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,039
said there we go that probably will look

650
00:26:14,039 --> 00:26:16,480
a little bit more interesting and this

651
00:26:16,480 --> 00:26:19,080
one again this sticks out as if it

652
00:26:19,080 --> 00:26:20,840
should be a different color this

653
00:26:20,840 --> 00:26:23,360
platform should probably be darker as

654
00:26:23,360 --> 00:26:25,080
well

655
00:26:25,080 --> 00:26:28,919
and I think I wonder if um

656
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:30,960
for the for the game I actually shaded a

657
00:26:30,960 --> 00:26:33,360
lot of stuff smooth nearly everything so

658
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:36,480
I think I should uh step up a lot of the

659
00:26:36,480 --> 00:26:40,399
sh smooth shading here cuz if I if if I

660
00:26:40,399 --> 00:26:42,840
select everything and could do shade

661
00:26:42,840 --> 00:26:44,440
smooth it probably won't look so good

662
00:26:44,440 --> 00:26:46,799
here will

663
00:26:47,840 --> 00:26:50,640
it I'm expecting this to look stupid in

664
00:26:50,640 --> 00:26:52,559
the game so let's try

665
00:26:52,559 --> 00:26:55,600
it yeah looks like that's good then we

666
00:26:55,600 --> 00:26:58,600
know

667
00:26:58,919 --> 00:27:02,360
uh this is looking too plain it

668
00:27:02,360 --> 00:27:04,960
inset alt e extrud long face normals

669
00:27:04,960 --> 00:27:06,600
hold the ALT key see the difference here

670
00:27:06,600 --> 00:27:08,279
it's a subtle different but if I do a

671
00:27:08,279 --> 00:27:09,880
little bit more hold the ALT key see in

672
00:27:09,880 --> 00:27:11,919
the center there it just uh otherwise

673
00:27:11,919 --> 00:27:13,399
it'll

674
00:27:13,399 --> 00:27:15,840
incorrectly like scale it so hold the

675
00:27:15,840 --> 00:27:19,080
ALT key here just that'll make it

676
00:27:19,080 --> 00:27:24,559
right dark to there and then here it set

677
00:27:24,559 --> 00:27:27,000
alt e extreme long face normals hold the

678
00:27:27,000 --> 00:27:28,960
ALT key

679
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:31,360
again like a dark window and this is

680
00:27:31,360 --> 00:27:33,559
looking way too plain so time for

681
00:27:33,559 --> 00:27:38,399
accents Shifty to duplicate this one

682
00:27:38,399 --> 00:27:41,320
scale bring in actually I can scale this

683
00:27:41,320 --> 00:27:43,679
whole thing

684
00:27:43,799 --> 00:27:47,399
up and Shifty to duplicate x-axis and

685
00:27:47,399 --> 00:27:50,480
then three of these that's good scale X

686
00:27:50,480 --> 00:27:53,480
bring them down a little bit

687
00:27:53,840 --> 00:27:57,120
more and here's probably space for

688
00:27:57,120 --> 00:27:59,840
another platform e to

689
00:27:59,840 --> 00:28:02,039
extrude cuz there's a lot of research

690
00:28:02,039 --> 00:28:07,320
going on in here remember scale x e to

691
00:28:07,320 --> 00:28:09,200
extrude I should probably have some

692
00:28:09,200 --> 00:28:11,240
emissive uh surfaces on the inside here

693
00:28:11,240 --> 00:28:12,279
later

694
00:28:12,279 --> 00:28:16,039
on here we go Control Plus G move it to

695
00:28:16,039 --> 00:28:18,519
there this is also looking way too

696
00:28:18,519 --> 00:28:22,519
plain so maybe thinner accents here

697
00:28:22,519 --> 00:28:25,480
should we try that yep we should Shifty

698
00:28:25,480 --> 00:28:28,760
to duplicate scale bring in in E to

699
00:28:28,760 --> 00:28:33,799
extrude bring this one in El select link

700
00:28:34,480 --> 00:28:36,960
accent El select link and repetition

701
00:28:36,960 --> 00:28:39,000
usually looks good too so Shifty to

702
00:28:39,000 --> 00:28:42,120
duplicate Z axis Shifty to duplicate Z

703
00:28:42,120 --> 00:28:45,360
axis and we'll put three of them there

704
00:28:45,360 --> 00:28:47,799
but that turned out to be too

705
00:28:47,799 --> 00:28:50,159
high so I'll have to move this one down

706
00:28:50,159 --> 00:28:55,640
a bit and this one down a bit

707
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,960
too okay

708
00:28:58,960 --> 00:29:03,000
here looking too plain on this side I

709
00:29:03,000 --> 00:29:05,720
think but we can get away with it maybe

710
00:29:05,720 --> 00:29:07,919
for

711
00:29:09,120 --> 00:29:15,159
now um should we put some sort of a pole

712
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,960
here right click subdivide Circle scale

713
00:29:20,960 --> 00:29:22,600
e to

714
00:29:22,600 --> 00:29:25,960
extrude actually maybe we'll

715
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,960
do shift

716
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,919
Zed maybe we should have some

717
00:29:32,919 --> 00:29:35,760
cylindrical building here that's like

718
00:29:35,760 --> 00:29:38,120
integrated into this

719
00:29:38,120 --> 00:29:40,960
one X and then do limited disolve we

720
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:43,120
don't need those extra lines up

721
00:29:43,120 --> 00:29:47,320
there let's flip this one rotate Z

722
00:29:47,320 --> 00:29:51,159
180 make this one a bit

723
00:29:51,600 --> 00:29:53,399
wider

724
00:29:53,399 --> 00:29:56,640
and up to here and then Shifty to

725
00:29:56,640 --> 00:30:00,399
duplicate it e to extrude shift e to

726
00:30:00,399 --> 00:30:03,159
duplicate and E to extrude e to extrude

727
00:30:03,159 --> 00:30:04,399
S to

728
00:30:04,399 --> 00:30:06,679
scale don't know why this is looking a

729
00:30:06,679 --> 00:30:08,120
bit like a lighthouse but we'll figure

730
00:30:08,120 --> 00:30:09,720
out what to do with

731
00:30:09,720 --> 00:30:16,880
that and it inset e to extrude and

732
00:30:18,200 --> 00:30:21,360
darker okay now we're starting to get to

733
00:30:21,360 --> 00:30:23,000
like having a little bit of detail

734
00:30:23,000 --> 00:30:26,880
everywhere I'd say it inset it to

735
00:30:26,880 --> 00:30:29,200
extrude

736
00:30:29,200 --> 00:30:30,760
we don't want the accent to go through

737
00:30:30,760 --> 00:30:33,000
so move that one into

738
00:30:33,000 --> 00:30:37,080
here Control Plus on the keypad there or

739
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:40,679
numpad and control minus there we

740
00:30:40,679 --> 00:30:44,399
go two plane here as well maybe a bridge

741
00:30:44,399 --> 00:30:46,760
over probably not because it would

742
00:30:46,760 --> 00:30:50,760
interfere with this one but I I mean we

743
00:30:50,760 --> 00:30:52,760
could control

744
00:30:52,760 --> 00:30:55,840
B it's like a corridor that'll

745
00:30:55,840 --> 00:30:59,039
work and then contrl r

746
00:30:59,039 --> 00:31:00,799
okay before I bevel I'm going to do the

747
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:05,799
control R control r contrl r bevel and

748
00:31:05,799 --> 00:31:08,279
then it doesn't really make sense that

749
00:31:08,279 --> 00:31:11,000
those are but I'll I'll look maybe it

750
00:31:11,000 --> 00:31:13,200
makes sense we'll find out this is

751
00:31:13,200 --> 00:31:14,919
looking too plain as well but we can

752
00:31:14,919 --> 00:31:18,320
sort that out probably control R control

753
00:31:18,320 --> 00:31:22,840
r contrl b should we bevel just one

754
00:31:22,840 --> 00:31:28,120
there these two contrl B

755
00:31:29,039 --> 00:31:30,960
that should

756
00:31:30,960 --> 00:31:33,799
work and these could be like as if it's

757
00:31:33,799 --> 00:31:35,279
like glass or something as well so let's

758
00:31:35,279 --> 00:31:37,440
go

759
00:31:37,440 --> 00:31:40,559
darker maybe let's try

760
00:31:40,559 --> 00:31:47,679
it a little bit more uh file export fpx

761
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:50,799
export and bring it into the game and on

762
00:31:50,799 --> 00:31:52,799
pause let's have some units walking

763
00:31:52,799 --> 00:31:56,320
around here as well

764
00:31:58,399 --> 00:31:59,960
should we put

765
00:31:59,960 --> 00:32:02,880
some war going on here as well probably

766
00:32:02,880 --> 00:32:05,440
needs I mean I'm okay with it uh but it

767
00:32:05,440 --> 00:32:07,919
probably needs a little bit

768
00:32:07,919 --> 00:32:11,279
more interesting features maybe animate

769
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,799
it a little

770
00:32:21,559 --> 00:32:23,760
bit why is he just shooting without

771
00:32:23,760 --> 00:32:26,000
aiming he needs to aim at it that's a

772
00:32:26,000 --> 00:32:29,760
little bug that'll get fixed

773
00:32:29,760 --> 00:32:31,399
uh I'm going to rotate a little bit so

774
00:32:31,399 --> 00:32:33,240
let's see

775
00:32:33,240 --> 00:32:36,480
Academy here we

776
00:32:36,480 --> 00:32:39,080
go and

777
00:32:39,080 --> 00:32:42,600
rotate I need a

778
00:32:42,639 --> 00:32:46,919
medic oh yeah some Shadows up

779
00:32:55,919 --> 00:32:58,480
there is damage already work working

780
00:32:58,480 --> 00:33:00,440
yeah I've got a material for damage so

781
00:33:00,440 --> 00:33:03,159
it just distorts the polygons and puts a

782
00:33:03,159 --> 00:33:05,600
like a dark darker texture on it so it

783
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,399
already works but the explosion of it is

784
00:33:07,399 --> 00:33:09,760
not going to look correct but the damage

785
00:33:09,760 --> 00:33:11,679
already works I should talk about that

786
00:33:11,679 --> 00:33:13,279
it's basically just a material if I

787
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,639
pause there and then we'll do the

788
00:33:15,639 --> 00:33:17,840
academy let's have a look

789
00:33:17,840 --> 00:33:20,840
on press there cuz that might be

790
00:33:20,840 --> 00:33:22,919
interesting to know about

791
00:33:22,919 --> 00:33:25,519
mesh it's called town here but it's not

792
00:33:25,519 --> 00:33:28,679
see here player

793
00:33:28,679 --> 00:33:31,559
so this material if I double click on it

794
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:34,080
maybe I can find it opening Shader

795
00:33:34,080 --> 00:33:36,799
editor I'm actually using they were on

796
00:33:36,799 --> 00:33:39,559
the built-in render pipeline so this one

797
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:41,880
is using uh this type of a damage

798
00:33:41,880 --> 00:33:44,480
texture and then it just uh projects it

799
00:33:44,480 --> 00:33:46,919
onto three different faces like a cube

800
00:33:46,919 --> 00:33:50,000
projection and then it uh uses those

801
00:33:50,000 --> 00:33:53,639
Cloud textures and it distorts the uh

802
00:33:53,639 --> 00:33:55,760
the vertex offset here as well so I'm

803
00:33:55,760 --> 00:33:57,000
not going to go through too much but

804
00:33:57,000 --> 00:33:59,320
it's basically just the slider that

805
00:33:59,320 --> 00:34:00,919
offsets the vertices a little bit on the

806
00:34:00,919 --> 00:34:03,320
building and then gradually increases

807
00:34:03,320 --> 00:34:07,039
these noise textures onto the um just

808
00:34:07,039 --> 00:34:09,199
like project them onto the building but

809
00:34:09,199 --> 00:34:10,879
it works pretty simple that way so it's

810
00:34:10,879 --> 00:34:13,520
basically just a slider from if I do

811
00:34:13,520 --> 00:34:16,560
here damage

812
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:18,760
here maybe we'll zoom in a little bit

813
00:34:18,760 --> 00:34:21,679
more okay not like

814
00:34:21,679 --> 00:34:26,639
that so damage zero damage and distort

815
00:34:26,639 --> 00:34:28,159
the vertices a little bit on the cloud

816
00:34:28,159 --> 00:34:30,918
texture and then also just fade that

817
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:33,359
damage texture in so saves you having to

818
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,520
do like when we created the game first I

819
00:34:35,520 --> 00:34:36,800
created three different models and

820
00:34:36,800 --> 00:34:39,199
switched out the mesh but this is uh so

821
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:40,800
much

822
00:34:40,800 --> 00:34:43,159
easier all right folks there we have it

823
00:34:43,159 --> 00:34:45,239
we prototyped ourselves a little academy

824
00:34:45,239 --> 00:34:47,280
building for the game line war and we'll

825
00:34:47,280 --> 00:34:49,800
see I probably need to modify it quite a

826
00:34:49,800 --> 00:34:51,760
bit before the final version ends up in

827
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:53,679
the game at least this is a like a rough

828
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:55,639
draft of what it could look like and

829
00:34:55,639 --> 00:34:57,320
then um there's a lot of other stuff

830
00:34:57,320 --> 00:34:59,200
that goes into creating this building

831
00:34:59,200 --> 00:35:01,000
because I need to be able to I need to

832
00:35:01,000 --> 00:35:02,720
animate it inside of unity so when it's

833
00:35:02,720 --> 00:35:04,599
constructed it like slides up the

834
00:35:04,599 --> 00:35:06,119
different accents and it adds the

835
00:35:06,119 --> 00:35:07,400
different floors and it creates a

836
00:35:07,400 --> 00:35:09,359
scaffolding on and it usually needs like

837
00:35:09,359 --> 00:35:11,040
a robot that it looks like it's building

838
00:35:11,040 --> 00:35:13,599
it so that's a lot of work and also need

839
00:35:13,599 --> 00:35:15,040
to fracture it and have like a

840
00:35:15,040 --> 00:35:16,839
destruction model so when the the units

841
00:35:16,839 --> 00:35:18,880
shoot it and blow it up it needs to like

842
00:35:18,880 --> 00:35:20,800
explode in the right place but just to

843
00:35:20,800 --> 00:35:23,440
get the mesh like roughed out and

844
00:35:23,440 --> 00:35:25,640
blocked out and then imported into the

845
00:35:25,640 --> 00:35:27,119
game it's uh pretty simple and

846
00:35:27,119 --> 00:35:28,240
straightforward

847
00:35:28,240 --> 00:35:31,040
so but then the devil's in the details

848
00:35:31,040 --> 00:35:33,280
then there's a little extra work added

849
00:35:33,280 --> 00:35:34,800
onto that I hope you like the video give

850
00:35:34,800 --> 00:35:36,280
it a thumbs up if you did and don't
