1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,860
hello everyone and welcome to the last

2
00:00:01,860 --> 00:00:03,600
episode of the 10 minute modeling

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,520
challenge that I will be filming in this

4
00:00:05,520 --> 00:00:08,099
room I think so anyway because tomorrow

5
00:00:08,099 --> 00:00:09,480
we'll be getting the keys for the next

6
00:00:09,480 --> 00:00:11,099
house that we're gonna move to so we've

7
00:00:11,099 --> 00:00:12,360
lived in this house for one year now

8
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:14,099
since we moved to Australia and we want

9
00:00:14,099 --> 00:00:15,540
to look around a little bit and we're

10
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,340
excited to try a new house in a new

11
00:00:17,340 --> 00:00:18,960
neighborhood so we're moving just about

12
00:00:18,960 --> 00:00:21,660
five minutes in that direction uh to an

13
00:00:21,660 --> 00:00:23,400
even steeper Hill actually so it's going

14
00:00:23,400 --> 00:00:24,900
to be a little bit more exercise when I

15
00:00:24,900 --> 00:00:25,920
go up and down which is going to be

16
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:26,939
great actually I'm going to be driving

17
00:00:26,939 --> 00:00:28,800
the car most of the time so probably a

18
00:00:28,800 --> 00:00:31,260
zero exercise but still it sounds uh

19
00:00:31,260 --> 00:00:32,520
like it's gonna be a nice place I'm

20
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:35,040
really excited so uh that's going to be

21
00:00:35,040 --> 00:00:37,440
happening and I'm we still have this

22
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,940
house for another two weeks so it's a

23
00:00:38,940 --> 00:00:40,860
bit of an overlap but I think that I'll

24
00:00:40,860 --> 00:00:42,360
be recording the next episode in the

25
00:00:42,360 --> 00:00:44,160
other house so this is

26
00:00:44,160 --> 00:00:45,960
I probably wasn't lying when I said that

27
00:00:45,960 --> 00:00:47,820
this might be or I said it was going to

28
00:00:47,820 --> 00:00:49,500
be the last one in this room so I better

29
00:00:49,500 --> 00:00:51,420
stick to it so hopefully I'll get the

30
00:00:51,420 --> 00:00:53,460
internet to work the internet to work in

31
00:00:53,460 --> 00:00:55,320
the new house as well and it should be

32
00:00:55,320 --> 00:00:56,760
connected and it should hopefully be

33
00:00:56,760 --> 00:00:58,680
fiber again otherwise I'll panic because

34
00:00:58,680 --> 00:01:00,719
I cannot go back to anything else than

35
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:03,120
fiber it needs to be high speed up and

36
00:01:03,120 --> 00:01:04,860
down and even to Europe it seems to be

37
00:01:04,860 --> 00:01:06,600
working pretty decently these days but I

38
00:01:06,600 --> 00:01:08,280
that's beyond my control in me but I

39
00:01:08,280 --> 00:01:10,080
think it's only two hop like through

40
00:01:10,080 --> 00:01:11,600
Singapore or something like pretty crazy

41
00:01:11,600 --> 00:01:13,979
so that's going to be happening I'm

42
00:01:13,979 --> 00:01:16,500
going to be literally after this episode

43
00:01:16,500 --> 00:01:18,659
tomorrow get the keys and then pack

44
00:01:18,659 --> 00:01:20,580
everything down and then shift all the

45
00:01:20,580 --> 00:01:22,200
stuff we haven't got a tremendous amount

46
00:01:22,200 --> 00:01:24,420
of stuff because we moved from Sweden

47
00:01:24,420 --> 00:01:26,340
with only 13 suitcases for a family of

48
00:01:26,340 --> 00:01:28,080
five so whatever we've got now is stuff

49
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,820
that we had to panic purchase because we

50
00:01:29,820 --> 00:01:31,979
rented an unfurnished house so we had to

51
00:01:31,979 --> 00:01:34,140
look on Ikea I had to sit for like I

52
00:01:34,140 --> 00:01:35,400
don't know two weeks solid and just

53
00:01:35,400 --> 00:01:37,619
assemble a lot of Ikea furniture so now

54
00:01:37,619 --> 00:01:39,060
we're going to be moving that along with

55
00:01:39,060 --> 00:01:41,520
the washer dryer and because I'm fridge

56
00:01:41,520 --> 00:01:43,259
because in this country when you move

57
00:01:43,259 --> 00:01:44,939
into a different house that doesn't come

58
00:01:44,939 --> 00:01:47,040
along with it so I'm pretty used to the

59
00:01:47,040 --> 00:01:48,420
way it works in Sweden a fridge and a

60
00:01:48,420 --> 00:01:50,220
freezer and washing machines everything

61
00:01:50,220 --> 00:01:51,659
like that stays in the house which is

62
00:01:51,659 --> 00:01:53,640
pretty convenient but in this case we

63
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,140
have to bring it all so that's going to

64
00:01:55,140 --> 00:01:56,759
be interesting but we've got a bit of a

65
00:01:56,759 --> 00:01:58,020
moving company to help us out with that

66
00:01:58,020 --> 00:01:59,700
all right so what else is happening I'm

67
00:01:59,700 --> 00:02:01,619
reading a book how about that for the

68
00:02:01,619 --> 00:02:03,180
first time in my life oh well actually

69
00:02:03,180 --> 00:02:06,180
not true 100 because I did read Rainbow

70
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:08,880
Six in the late 90s because I like the

71
00:02:08,880 --> 00:02:10,199
game so I thought I'd have to read the

72
00:02:10,199 --> 00:02:11,580
book I love that one and then I've just

73
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,200
not read since then first of all I'm

74
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:14,819
reading a game design book that I got

75
00:02:14,819 --> 00:02:16,560
recommended so I'll be able to give it a

76
00:02:16,560 --> 00:02:17,819
little review on that one because I need

77
00:02:17,819 --> 00:02:19,739
to learn a lot about game design it's

78
00:02:19,739 --> 00:02:21,720
not as easy as making uh just

79
00:02:21,720 --> 00:02:23,580
technically making a game so here's a

80
00:02:23,580 --> 00:02:24,660
bit of a tip for you if you're

81
00:02:24,660 --> 00:02:26,400
interested in making games a lot of the

82
00:02:26,400 --> 00:02:28,620
courses out there Focus very heavily on

83
00:02:28,620 --> 00:02:30,780
just like how do you use Unity how do

84
00:02:30,780 --> 00:02:32,340
you get a thing to move how do you jump

85
00:02:32,340 --> 00:02:33,900
how do you do a platformer how do you do

86
00:02:33,900 --> 00:02:35,520
a first person shooter how do you do a

87
00:02:35,520 --> 00:02:37,440
racing Simulator game but very few

88
00:02:37,440 --> 00:02:39,720
actually focus on the fact that you know

89
00:02:39,720 --> 00:02:41,099
it should really be a fun game it's

90
00:02:41,099 --> 00:02:42,720
taken me about 20 years to realize that

91
00:02:42,720 --> 00:02:44,700
because it's very easy doing doing like

92
00:02:44,700 --> 00:02:46,379
15 ludum tires that I've done I've

93
00:02:46,379 --> 00:02:48,060
learned it the hard way that it's very

94
00:02:48,060 --> 00:02:49,620
easy to put together the game and you go

95
00:02:49,620 --> 00:02:51,239
oh this might be fun and then you get

96
00:02:51,239 --> 00:02:52,920
the feedback from players going nah it's

97
00:02:52,920 --> 00:02:54,300
not really that fun and then you

98
00:02:54,300 --> 00:02:55,440
actually play it yourself and you go

99
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,540
you're right this sucks it's pretty bad

100
00:02:57,540 --> 00:03:00,720
so I'm really wanting to upload level up

101
00:03:00,720 --> 00:03:02,879
my skills on the game design so I've

102
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,260
learned a lot through the Journey of

103
00:03:04,260 --> 00:03:06,060
line War as well because uh my code Dev

104
00:03:06,060 --> 00:03:08,160
there is really good when it comes to

105
00:03:08,160 --> 00:03:09,780
the balancing in the game design and why

106
00:03:09,780 --> 00:03:11,220
things should and should not be in the

107
00:03:11,220 --> 00:03:13,200
game and I hope that to be able to adapt

108
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,120
a lot of that thought process and I've

109
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,500
learned a lot of stuff not to do as well

110
00:03:16,500 --> 00:03:18,060
for example don't make a game that

111
00:03:18,060 --> 00:03:19,620
doesn't have single player like everyone

112
00:03:19,620 --> 00:03:21,720
told us not to do and we've learned it

113
00:03:21,720 --> 00:03:24,599
well still we prefer the multiplayer

114
00:03:24,599 --> 00:03:26,159
part but if you want to have a

115
00:03:26,159 --> 00:03:28,739
commercially successful game then you

116
00:03:28,739 --> 00:03:30,180
should probably implement single player

117
00:03:30,180 --> 00:03:32,819
and listen to what people say problem

118
00:03:32,819 --> 00:03:34,500
for me reading is that I fall asleep all

119
00:03:34,500 --> 00:03:36,120
the time and I've got the Kindle version

120
00:03:36,120 --> 00:03:38,700
and Kindle version sucks

121
00:03:38,700 --> 00:03:41,280
Kindle app sucks and I was really

122
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:42,959
surprised because I thought since it's

123
00:03:42,959 --> 00:03:44,640
been about 10 years since I saw Kindle

124
00:03:44,640 --> 00:03:46,019
and I thought surely it must have

125
00:03:46,019 --> 00:03:47,760
improved super good text-to-speech and

126
00:03:47,760 --> 00:03:48,840
everything like that I can just download

127
00:03:48,840 --> 00:03:51,360
the book and listen to it and they've

128
00:03:51,360 --> 00:03:53,040
disabled the feature you cannot actually

129
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:54,840
enable it anymore because I think they

130
00:03:54,840 --> 00:03:56,519
just want you to buy a Kindle device

131
00:03:56,519 --> 00:03:57,780
instead but I don't want to do that

132
00:03:57,780 --> 00:03:59,099
because I've already got a phone and

133
00:03:59,099 --> 00:04:01,500
I've got I've vowed not to get too many

134
00:04:01,500 --> 00:04:03,540
electrical devices am I recording yeah

135
00:04:03,540 --> 00:04:05,700
so I'm not going to buy a Kindle app I

136
00:04:05,700 --> 00:04:07,140
just want to be able to read it on my

137
00:04:07,140 --> 00:04:08,400
phone and I want to be able to switch on

138
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,739
text-to-speech on the PC version it has

139
00:04:10,739 --> 00:04:12,299
text-to-speech and I enabled that and I

140
00:04:12,299 --> 00:04:13,860
thought I'll listen on my PC then how

141
00:04:13,860 --> 00:04:15,840
about that it's tough to bring along but

142
00:04:15,840 --> 00:04:17,339
at least I could sit down here and

143
00:04:17,339 --> 00:04:18,959
listen to it and if you want to have a

144
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,940
book read by Stephen Hawkins it's an

145
00:04:20,940 --> 00:04:21,959
excellent thing because I don't think

146
00:04:21,959 --> 00:04:24,180
they've stated their speech synthesis

147
00:04:24,180 --> 00:04:27,720
it's like like 9080s or something so I

148
00:04:27,720 --> 00:04:29,280
don't recommend it unless you're

149
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,600
actually reading a book written by

150
00:04:30,600 --> 00:04:32,040
Stephen Hawking maybe that could be good

151
00:04:32,040 --> 00:04:33,540
but I don't want to listen to all the

152
00:04:33,540 --> 00:04:35,280
books like that it's not good not

153
00:04:35,280 --> 00:04:36,840
recommended let's just stick to the news

154
00:04:36,840 --> 00:04:40,259
as well blender version 4.0 is coming as

155
00:04:40,259 --> 00:04:42,360
well exciting huh and I'll summarize

156
00:04:42,360 --> 00:04:45,060
exactly what's exciting me about blender

157
00:04:45,060 --> 00:04:46,740
4.0

158
00:04:46,740 --> 00:04:48,540
with that said let's move on to

159
00:04:48,540 --> 00:04:49,620
something else because I couldn't

160
00:04:49,620 --> 00:04:50,880
actually find anything that interested

161
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:53,699
me in version 4.0 of blunder and it

162
00:04:53,699 --> 00:04:55,440
seems to be it's like uoi tweaks and

163
00:04:55,440 --> 00:04:58,080
some basic rigging things and maybe a

164
00:04:58,080 --> 00:04:59,639
lot of stuff with geometry notes which I

165
00:04:59,639 --> 00:05:00,660
don't really use because I haven't found

166
00:05:00,660 --> 00:05:02,940
a lot of use of the geometry notes yet I

167
00:05:02,940 --> 00:05:04,680
like to customize my low poly stuff and

168
00:05:04,680 --> 00:05:06,900
just stylistically model stuff even

169
00:05:06,900 --> 00:05:08,340
though I'm into procedurally generating

170
00:05:08,340 --> 00:05:09,720
things I haven't been able to do

171
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:11,580
anything that I necessarily want to do

172
00:05:11,580 --> 00:05:13,440
with geometry notes so I'm not super

173
00:05:13,440 --> 00:05:16,020
excited about for the oh yet but maybe I

174
00:05:16,020 --> 00:05:17,520
will be maybe someone will correct me

175
00:05:17,520 --> 00:05:19,020
and go hey you should check this out

176
00:05:19,020 --> 00:05:20,639
button so if you know something that I

177
00:05:20,639 --> 00:05:21,900
don't and that you think would interest

178
00:05:21,900 --> 00:05:23,960
me go ahead put it in the description

179
00:05:23,960 --> 00:05:26,280
one more update as well since we're on

180
00:05:26,280 --> 00:05:27,780
the topic of intros that are way too

181
00:05:27,780 --> 00:05:29,699
long for a 10 minute video check out the

182
00:05:29,699 --> 00:05:30,960
ghost behind me

183
00:05:30,960 --> 00:05:33,479
it's the it's the Pac-Man ghost and last

184
00:05:33,479 --> 00:05:36,000
week it cost their crayons anything

185
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,639
called crayons it caused chaos with my

186
00:05:38,639 --> 00:05:40,680
white balance because I had it on auto

187
00:05:40,680 --> 00:05:41,880
white balance which I know you're not

188
00:05:41,880 --> 00:05:43,380
supposed to have but I thought nothing

189
00:05:43,380 --> 00:05:44,820
is changing in the room well the ghost

190
00:05:44,820 --> 00:05:46,320
is Shifting color so I look like an

191
00:05:46,320 --> 00:05:47,820
Oompa Loompa half the time and then I

192
00:05:47,820 --> 00:05:49,500
look like a ghost myself half the time

193
00:05:49,500 --> 00:05:50,940
but I think I've fixed it now because I

194
00:05:50,940 --> 00:05:52,320
fixed the white balance so it should be

195
00:05:52,320 --> 00:05:53,940
fixed now and hopefully that goes behind

196
00:05:53,940 --> 00:05:55,620
me should just shift colors instead like

197
00:05:55,620 --> 00:05:57,300
the way it's meant to be doing I'm

198
00:05:57,300 --> 00:05:59,100
actually also reading another piece of

199
00:05:59,100 --> 00:06:01,440
text and I should probably not mention

200
00:06:01,440 --> 00:06:04,020
anyone here by name giselda I still well

201
00:06:04,020 --> 00:06:05,340
actually I can't really say your name

202
00:06:05,340 --> 00:06:06,780
but I'm really excited to read what

203
00:06:06,780 --> 00:06:08,280
you've got cooking there I know it's not

204
00:06:08,280 --> 00:06:10,020
sci-fi you say well I call it sci-fi but

205
00:06:10,020 --> 00:06:11,699
it's like a fiction anyway I actually

206
00:06:11,699 --> 00:06:13,560
really enjoyed reading it so keep up the

207
00:06:13,560 --> 00:06:15,240
good work and keep that going because I

208
00:06:15,240 --> 00:06:16,440
want to read the complete thing now I'm

209
00:06:16,440 --> 00:06:18,840
hooked onto your story so keep up the

210
00:06:18,840 --> 00:06:20,520
great job on that one I'm really excited

211
00:06:20,520 --> 00:06:22,080
to read more what you've got going there

212
00:06:22,080 --> 00:06:23,340
all right so I think that's pretty much

213
00:06:23,340 --> 00:06:25,860
sums up what I had to say and that's all

214
00:06:25,860 --> 00:06:28,440
I had to say about that maybe some

215
00:06:28,440 --> 00:06:29,699
people actually came to watch the

216
00:06:29,699 --> 00:06:32,039
modeling so I'm going to be jumping on

217
00:06:32,039 --> 00:06:33,900
the Discord challenge again the weekly

218
00:06:33,900 --> 00:06:35,699
Discord challenge has been going on for

219
00:06:35,699 --> 00:06:37,440
well over a year now and thanks to Arvid

220
00:06:37,440 --> 00:06:39,479
who's relentlessly putting up new themes

221
00:06:39,479 --> 00:06:41,220
and collecting all the stuff collecting

222
00:06:41,220 --> 00:06:43,440
it into git repo and he's waiting for me

223
00:06:43,440 --> 00:06:45,000
to create a video where I'm going to go

224
00:06:45,000 --> 00:06:46,440
through it and I'm panicking now because

225
00:06:46,440 --> 00:06:47,880
there's so many submissions there over

226
00:06:47,880 --> 00:06:49,919
like 50 weeks that I haven't gone

227
00:06:49,919 --> 00:06:51,720
through so I don't really know how to

228
00:06:51,720 --> 00:06:53,880
tackle it but I'm gonna probably build

229
00:06:53,880 --> 00:06:55,380
up my courage and tackle it at some

230
00:06:55,380 --> 00:06:56,639
point in the new house when we move

231
00:06:56,639 --> 00:06:58,740
there and maybe I can't really go

232
00:06:58,740 --> 00:07:00,840
through all the submissions but hey he's

233
00:07:00,840 --> 00:07:02,340
done it so good that it's got preview

234
00:07:02,340 --> 00:07:04,800
images so maybe I can select the best of

235
00:07:04,800 --> 00:07:07,139
so if you've been participating in the

236
00:07:07,139 --> 00:07:08,759
Discord challenge there stay tuned

237
00:07:08,759 --> 00:07:09,840
because I'll create the video about it

238
00:07:09,840 --> 00:07:11,639
and maybe your image will be reviewed

239
00:07:11,639 --> 00:07:13,440
and I'll get some feedback some

240
00:07:13,440 --> 00:07:15,419
criticism should I be harsh should I be

241
00:07:15,419 --> 00:07:17,460
kind should I be both I don't know I'll

242
00:07:17,460 --> 00:07:20,039
figure it out so I should criticize my

243
00:07:20,039 --> 00:07:21,360
own junk sometimes as well because half

244
00:07:21,360 --> 00:07:23,280
the stuff I make look here hideous but

245
00:07:23,280 --> 00:07:25,020
I'm not afraid to say that just look at

246
00:07:25,020 --> 00:07:26,220
my thumbnails from the 10 minute

247
00:07:26,220 --> 00:07:28,919
modeling challenge but then hey if you

248
00:07:28,919 --> 00:07:30,419
haven't followed me before this is where

249
00:07:30,419 --> 00:07:32,940
it comes in to just focus yourself on 10

250
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:33,900
minutes because then you've got an

251
00:07:33,900 --> 00:07:36,660
excellent excuse X excellent because you

252
00:07:36,660 --> 00:07:37,860
can say hey I did that in 10 minutes

253
00:07:37,860 --> 00:07:39,479
what can you expect what else have I

254
00:07:39,479 --> 00:07:40,740
been doing well I thought it was going

255
00:07:40,740 --> 00:07:42,120
to go a lot faster but I spent

256
00:07:42,120 --> 00:07:44,699
apparently 35 hours roughly modeling

257
00:07:44,699 --> 00:07:46,860
interior objects for the low poly packs

258
00:07:46,860 --> 00:07:48,660
and they're compatible with a crispy

259
00:07:48,660 --> 00:07:51,539
crisply characters mini so now I've got

260
00:07:51,539 --> 00:07:54,419
crisply Interiors modern really like

261
00:07:54,419 --> 00:07:55,860
backwards with the naming there but it's

262
00:07:55,860 --> 00:07:57,539
crispy Interiors is the collection and

263
00:07:57,539 --> 00:07:58,919
then it's the modern because I realized

264
00:07:58,919 --> 00:08:01,139
I have to do fantasy packs or sci-fi and

265
00:08:01,139 --> 00:08:03,000
cyberpunk in the future as well so I've

266
00:08:03,000 --> 00:08:04,860
created this one took me about 35 hours

267
00:08:04,860 --> 00:08:06,419
because I know that it took about 35

268
00:08:06,419 --> 00:08:08,039
hours because I recorded the whole

269
00:08:08,039 --> 00:08:09,840
process and then I turned it into a time

270
00:08:09,840 --> 00:08:11,220
lapse that I played at four times the

271
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:12,900
speed and that turned into about seven

272
00:08:12,900 --> 00:08:15,060
seven and a half hours so if my math is

273
00:08:15,060 --> 00:08:16,620
correct which it probably isn't well

274
00:08:16,620 --> 00:08:18,720
maybe it's 30 hours or whatever so I'll

275
00:08:18,720 --> 00:08:19,860
figure it out yeah I'm really excited

276
00:08:19,860 --> 00:08:21,360
about that one because I imported all

277
00:08:21,360 --> 00:08:22,860
the objects and created a little demo

278
00:08:22,860 --> 00:08:25,139
scene inside of Unreal Engine and uh

279
00:08:25,139 --> 00:08:27,300
Unreal Engine is really cool because it

280
00:08:27,300 --> 00:08:29,099
actually works extremely good now I got

281
00:08:29,099 --> 00:08:31,500
Nani to work and then I also got the

282
00:08:31,500 --> 00:08:33,839
Lumen which is doing beautiful work

283
00:08:33,839 --> 00:08:36,179
actually with the emission so with the

284
00:08:36,179 --> 00:08:37,860
in fancy a pixel texture that you might

285
00:08:37,860 --> 00:08:39,179
be using now hopefully if you haven't

286
00:08:39,179 --> 00:08:40,500
just check out the link in the

287
00:08:40,500 --> 00:08:42,779
description and go grab it because that

288
00:08:42,779 --> 00:08:45,300
emission works extremely good in Unreal

289
00:08:45,300 --> 00:08:47,160
Engine so the Lumen just picks up all

290
00:08:47,160 --> 00:08:49,200
the emissive surfaces and actually uses

291
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,820
it pretty much as a light but without

292
00:08:50,820 --> 00:08:53,640
any Shadows but it I'm really happy with

293
00:08:53,640 --> 00:08:55,080
the way it looks so I'm excited about

294
00:08:55,080 --> 00:08:57,000
that one so that pack I'll be releasing

295
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,680
onto my website and I've also got some

296
00:08:58,680 --> 00:08:59,880
other channels where I'll be releasing

297
00:08:59,880 --> 00:09:01,500
it one of them being the unit asset

298
00:09:01,500 --> 00:09:03,180
store and then when the Fab store is

299
00:09:03,180 --> 00:09:04,620
coming from epic later on I'm going to

300
00:09:04,620 --> 00:09:06,420
be releasing it there too and I'll also

301
00:09:06,420 --> 00:09:08,760
give it to my hero tier on my patrons as

302
00:09:08,760 --> 00:09:10,320
well just need to finalize the packaging

303
00:09:10,320 --> 00:09:12,120
and then launch it and then move on to

304
00:09:12,120 --> 00:09:14,100
the next pack all right then so I know

305
00:09:14,100 --> 00:09:15,540
you've been waiting a lot for the

306
00:09:15,540 --> 00:09:17,760
modeling now but I just want to say one

307
00:09:17,760 --> 00:09:19,620
more thing actually and that is I had a

308
00:09:19,620 --> 00:09:21,899
few more questions about Ultra Nova so

309
00:09:21,899 --> 00:09:23,760
earlier a few months ago I released some

310
00:09:23,760 --> 00:09:25,560
teasers about Ultra Nova and I developed

311
00:09:25,560 --> 00:09:27,120
that prototype that was going to be the

312
00:09:27,120 --> 00:09:29,279
full game inside of unity and since then

313
00:09:29,279 --> 00:09:31,140
I've realized I actually love the the

314
00:09:31,140 --> 00:09:32,820
way that Unreal Engine is presenting all

315
00:09:32,820 --> 00:09:34,860
the graphics and the way I can just cram

316
00:09:34,860 --> 00:09:36,660
all the polygons in there so I've been

317
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:38,220
learning behind the scenes pretty much

318
00:09:38,220 --> 00:09:40,019
Unreal Engine to the point where I'm

319
00:09:40,019 --> 00:09:41,459
starting to feel quite comfortable now

320
00:09:41,459 --> 00:09:43,380
at least with the with the way I can do

321
00:09:43,380 --> 00:09:45,420
the graphically and the graphic

322
00:09:45,420 --> 00:09:46,860
appearance and stuff I'm still learning

323
00:09:46,860 --> 00:09:49,019
a bit of C plus plus and the blueprint

324
00:09:49,019 --> 00:09:50,459
still still got a long way to go but I'm

325
00:09:50,459 --> 00:09:52,019
at a point where I can soon start to

326
00:09:52,019 --> 00:09:54,060
actually assemble what I had in unity

327
00:09:54,060 --> 00:09:56,160
into Unreal Engine and then I'll be

328
00:09:56,160 --> 00:09:57,480
building it from there so I'm really

329
00:09:57,480 --> 00:09:59,339
excited about that one and behind the

330
00:09:59,339 --> 00:10:01,260
scenes it's also been a huge process to

331
00:10:01,260 --> 00:10:02,760
update the game design document because

332
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:05,880
uh I I have to whisper now because one

333
00:10:05,880 --> 00:10:08,100
thing that is not popular amongst my

334
00:10:08,100 --> 00:10:11,220
subscribers is AI and if I say AI I lose

335
00:10:11,220 --> 00:10:12,839
subscribers I that's why I'm whispering

336
00:10:12,839 --> 00:10:14,700
that and when I created a video thinking

337
00:10:14,700 --> 00:10:16,080
that this is going to be popular because

338
00:10:16,080 --> 00:10:19,320
I said I'll I asked chat GPT to help me

339
00:10:19,320 --> 00:10:22,320
make a game and then it didn't really it

340
00:10:22,320 --> 00:10:24,000
wasn't that popular and I think I

341
00:10:24,000 --> 00:10:25,380
understand why because it's like

342
00:10:25,380 --> 00:10:27,959
everyone's doing that and then while

343
00:10:27,959 --> 00:10:29,880
we're discussing it in the Discord and

344
00:10:29,880 --> 00:10:32,399
it's actually not really that good to

345
00:10:32,399 --> 00:10:33,660
come up with a game design because it

346
00:10:33,660 --> 00:10:35,160
can provide some useful hints but if

347
00:10:35,160 --> 00:10:36,839
you're expecting it to create a Sci-Fi

348
00:10:36,839 --> 00:10:38,820
story or a fictional story it's just

349
00:10:38,820 --> 00:10:40,680
gonna left and right grab stuff from all

350
00:10:40,680 --> 00:10:42,540
over like existing stories and it won't

351
00:10:42,540 --> 00:10:44,279
tell you it'll sound confident like it's

352
00:10:44,279 --> 00:10:45,959
coming up with something on the fly but

353
00:10:45,959 --> 00:10:47,519
it turns out like the names are taken

354
00:10:47,519 --> 00:10:49,140
from this one names of the planets is

355
00:10:49,140 --> 00:10:50,940
taken from this the story plot is from

356
00:10:50,940 --> 00:10:53,279
this either game or series or sci-fi or

357
00:10:53,279 --> 00:10:55,320
book or novel and you don't know what it

358
00:10:55,320 --> 00:10:56,760
comes from so people will be able to

359
00:10:56,760 --> 00:10:58,800
recognize that so again I shouldn't name

360
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:01,140
drop here but but yazilra that's what

361
00:11:01,140 --> 00:11:02,880
I'm going to say is helping me with a

362
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:04,980
really cool story so I'm I'm super

363
00:11:04,980 --> 00:11:06,660
excited to share more about that so

364
00:11:06,660 --> 00:11:07,860
we've been working in the game design

365
00:11:07,860 --> 00:11:10,380
document a lot so thumbs up thanks a lot

366
00:11:10,380 --> 00:11:12,060
for your help so far I'm really eager to

367
00:11:12,060 --> 00:11:13,800
actually put all the stuff that you

368
00:11:13,800 --> 00:11:15,540
helped me with there and straighten the

369
00:11:15,540 --> 00:11:17,279
story out it's a really cool plot now

370
00:11:17,279 --> 00:11:18,839
it's got a lot more twists and

371
00:11:18,839 --> 00:11:21,120
characters and everything's strung

372
00:11:21,120 --> 00:11:22,980
together nicely we'll still have some

373
00:11:22,980 --> 00:11:24,959
work to do on that front but I'm really

374
00:11:24,959 --> 00:11:26,220
excited I think it's going to turn out

375
00:11:26,220 --> 00:11:28,019
to be a really cool platformer now it's

376
00:11:28,019 --> 00:11:29,880
gonna have some swing backs to turken 2

377
00:11:29,880 --> 00:11:31,440
style because I love that that era of

378
00:11:31,440 --> 00:11:33,660
gaming I like the Sci-Fi part of it the

379
00:11:33,660 --> 00:11:35,880
robot style character I like the glowy

380
00:11:35,880 --> 00:11:38,640
neon firing balls and then I like the

381
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,839
music style and everything like that so

382
00:11:39,839 --> 00:11:40,740
it's going to have a lot of those

383
00:11:40,740 --> 00:11:42,720
elements but a lot of new fresh contents

384
00:11:42,720 --> 00:11:44,399
as well so in the form of a narrative

385
00:11:44,399 --> 00:11:45,660
that's going to be way better than

386
00:11:45,660 --> 00:11:47,160
anything I could have come up with in

387
00:11:47,160 --> 00:11:48,540
Ultra Nova there's going to be a load of

388
00:11:48,540 --> 00:11:50,399
drone enemies and the theme this week in

389
00:11:50,399 --> 00:11:51,839
the 10 minute not in the 10 minute

390
00:11:51,839 --> 00:11:53,820
modeling challenge in the Discord is

391
00:11:53,820 --> 00:11:55,560
actually drones you can make either one

392
00:11:55,560 --> 00:11:57,540
or more and I'm gonna try to wake wake

393
00:11:57,540 --> 00:12:00,360
make one drone here so a drone it is and

394
00:12:00,360 --> 00:12:01,740
I'm gonna be modeling it right here

395
00:12:01,740 --> 00:12:04,260
right inside binder 3.6 now no need to

396
00:12:04,260 --> 00:12:06,660
go to 4.0 beta because I know it's a lot

397
00:12:06,660 --> 00:12:08,100
of hype but I don't need that I don't

398
00:12:08,100 --> 00:12:09,839
need crashes anyway so I'm gonna stick

399
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:13,500
to 3.62 for a while Ready Steady

400
00:12:13,500 --> 00:12:16,440
go we're counting yep we are all right

401
00:12:16,440 --> 00:12:18,420
so I'm gonna do shift d to duplicate the

402
00:12:18,420 --> 00:12:20,040
top face there move that to the side

403
00:12:20,040 --> 00:12:21,839
let's do automator actually because I

404
00:12:21,839 --> 00:12:23,700
want to be able to have the Drone arms

405
00:12:23,700 --> 00:12:26,519
here and then this one I'm gonna do

406
00:12:26,519 --> 00:12:30,420
e to extrude and control R oh no do you

407
00:12:30,420 --> 00:12:32,100
know what I'm gonna make this I'll do my

408
00:12:32,100 --> 00:12:33,959
usual check right click subdivide and

409
00:12:33,959 --> 00:12:37,320
next go Circle X and then dissolve

410
00:12:37,320 --> 00:12:40,560
limited and then e to extrude and here's

411
00:12:40,560 --> 00:12:42,180
gonna be all set well it's not going to

412
00:12:42,180 --> 00:12:44,519
be there high to inset

413
00:12:44,519 --> 00:12:47,339
and right click and let's do a bridge

414
00:12:47,339 --> 00:12:49,380
faces so there we go our little cylinder

415
00:12:49,380 --> 00:12:51,360
that I want and then I'll e to extrude

416
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:53,220
this one as to scale its scale on the

417
00:12:53,220 --> 00:12:55,860
z-axis Maybe and I can't remember what I

418
00:12:55,860 --> 00:12:57,899
don't look like but it's okay

419
00:12:57,899 --> 00:12:59,760
um and then I'm gonna put the propeller

420
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:01,620
thing in the center here

421
00:13:01,620 --> 00:13:04,860
Shifty to duplicate F to uh just do that

422
00:13:04,860 --> 00:13:07,260
on alt and then flip the normals do I

423
00:13:07,260 --> 00:13:09,480
need to do that no probably not

424
00:13:09,480 --> 00:13:12,180
okay but still and uh how should I do

425
00:13:12,180 --> 00:13:15,300
the propellers here I'll do Ester scale

426
00:13:15,300 --> 00:13:18,000
it's extrude and

427
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,459
L to select the link and just grab this

428
00:13:20,459 --> 00:13:22,620
one on the left here and move it up to

429
00:13:22,620 --> 00:13:25,320
here some gray color there we go and

430
00:13:25,320 --> 00:13:27,779
then alt right click F3 and then just do

431
00:13:27,779 --> 00:13:30,959
checker deselect and ALT extrude long

432
00:13:30,959 --> 00:13:33,480
face normals there we go

433
00:13:33,480 --> 00:13:35,760
have I got back facing on

434
00:13:35,760 --> 00:13:37,440
okay that's not supported there I

435
00:13:37,440 --> 00:13:40,260
thought it was flipped so alt n flip

436
00:13:40,260 --> 00:13:41,700
there you go

437
00:13:41,700 --> 00:13:43,620
go back I actually like the model in

438
00:13:43,620 --> 00:13:46,079
this view these days Zed and material

439
00:13:46,079 --> 00:13:47,760
preview there I don't know why

440
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:50,540
so we should do

441
00:13:50,540 --> 00:13:53,339
control okay so here's the stupid thing

442
00:13:53,339 --> 00:13:57,180
why am I modeling this one like this

443
00:13:57,180 --> 00:13:59,519
should not really be modeling all the

444
00:13:59,519 --> 00:14:01,019
blades at once you should do like an

445
00:14:01,019 --> 00:14:02,399
array modifier or something like that

446
00:14:02,399 --> 00:14:04,560
but never mind I'll try anyway I'll test

447
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:07,260
the scale scale on the z-axis

448
00:14:07,260 --> 00:14:09,899
uh make this scale and okay and I'll do

449
00:14:09,899 --> 00:14:12,660
period individual Origins period and go

450
00:14:12,660 --> 00:14:15,600
normal scale on their y-axis

451
00:14:15,600 --> 00:14:18,720
alt D to extrude long face normals and

452
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:22,459
maybe I'll do rotate on the z-axis

453
00:14:22,459 --> 00:14:24,959
uh there we go

454
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,760
I actually want this low poly look so

455
00:14:26,760 --> 00:14:27,720
I'm just going to keep them like that

456
00:14:27,720 --> 00:14:31,079
each extrude s to scale and I'll do some

457
00:14:31,079 --> 00:14:33,180
heat extrude that's the scale there so I

458
00:14:33,180 --> 00:14:34,380
think that's pretty good that's gonna be

459
00:14:34,380 --> 00:14:37,320
it for that little drone propeller thing

460
00:14:37,320 --> 00:14:39,360
here anyway it actually needs to be

461
00:14:39,360 --> 00:14:42,120
attached somewhere it's extrude should

462
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,620
it be from the top or the bottom the

463
00:14:43,620 --> 00:14:46,139
bottom I guess that's just oh no I won't

464
00:14:46,139 --> 00:14:47,940
scale that on yet I'll move it up it's

465
00:14:47,940 --> 00:14:50,639
extrude and then we'll just do some sort

466
00:14:50,639 --> 00:14:52,019
of a connection here

467
00:14:52,019 --> 00:14:55,560
bolt said that'll do eat extrude

468
00:14:55,560 --> 00:14:59,160
and well we can just bring it into there

469
00:14:59,160 --> 00:15:01,440
that's it so that makes a little bit

470
00:15:01,440 --> 00:15:02,699
more sense

471
00:15:02,699 --> 00:15:04,260
and then we'll do e to extrude that's

472
00:15:04,260 --> 00:15:05,459
the scale there for a little bit of

473
00:15:05,459 --> 00:15:06,540
feature how am I doing seven minutes

474
00:15:06,540 --> 00:15:09,540
okay so I've only got this thing I can

475
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:11,279
uh maybe I'll do a little bit more

476
00:15:11,279 --> 00:15:13,019
detail here as well I don't know what to

477
00:15:13,019 --> 00:15:15,779
do yet but let's scale this down

478
00:15:15,779 --> 00:15:17,579
alt select there

479
00:15:17,579 --> 00:15:20,279
and let's do it inset all tests to scale

480
00:15:20,279 --> 00:15:22,500
them down then I don't know what to do

481
00:15:22,500 --> 00:15:25,620
here but let's just punch a hole here or

482
00:15:25,620 --> 00:15:27,360
something no we shouldn't

483
00:15:27,360 --> 00:15:30,420
I'll just do like a little eye to inset

484
00:15:30,420 --> 00:15:32,940
and all test to scale along normals that

485
00:15:32,940 --> 00:15:37,139
should be I'll be okay I think

486
00:15:37,139 --> 00:15:38,820
some darker color here for some reason I

487
00:15:38,820 --> 00:15:40,440
want that have I got proportional one

488
00:15:40,440 --> 00:15:41,699
nope

489
00:15:41,699 --> 00:15:44,220
all right L to select the linked G to

490
00:15:44,220 --> 00:15:46,740
move it okay now I need to L to select

491
00:15:46,740 --> 00:15:48,959
this linked as well that's it then I'm

492
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,060
going to put this one here

493
00:15:51,060 --> 00:15:54,120
rotate it maybe okay I need to do comma

494
00:15:54,120 --> 00:15:57,899
and do Global period medium Point rotate

495
00:15:57,899 --> 00:16:00,240
and should I do I think I might do six

496
00:16:00,240 --> 00:16:02,579
just because I can duplicate them so

497
00:16:02,579 --> 00:16:04,440
fast

498
00:16:04,440 --> 00:16:06,899
Shifty white just have four that's

499
00:16:06,899 --> 00:16:08,760
boring

500
00:16:08,760 --> 00:16:10,920
so I'm gonna be doing it like this

501
00:16:10,920 --> 00:16:11,880
instead

502
00:16:11,880 --> 00:16:14,160
yeah that's it I have no idea why I do

503
00:16:14,160 --> 00:16:16,139
that but never mind

504
00:16:16,139 --> 00:16:18,120
so we'll bring this one up here and then

505
00:16:18,120 --> 00:16:20,220
what am I doing five minutes so half the

506
00:16:20,220 --> 00:16:21,540
time is done

507
00:16:21,540 --> 00:16:23,820
um e to extrude

508
00:16:23,820 --> 00:16:26,220
let's go each extrude here this is a bit

509
00:16:26,220 --> 00:16:28,680
like a spaceship I guess

510
00:16:28,680 --> 00:16:32,639
scale z e to extrude S to scale I think

511
00:16:32,639 --> 00:16:35,040
I'll scale this one too I have no idea

512
00:16:35,040 --> 00:16:36,660
really what to do here

513
00:16:36,660 --> 00:16:38,160
so I'll just have to randomize a little

514
00:16:38,160 --> 00:16:40,500
bit e to extrude I think I want to have

515
00:16:40,500 --> 00:16:41,339
like

516
00:16:41,339 --> 00:16:43,380
each extrude for some reason I feel like

517
00:16:43,380 --> 00:16:44,880
having something that pokes out like

518
00:16:44,880 --> 00:16:45,959
this

519
00:16:45,959 --> 00:16:47,339
and then I think I want to have

520
00:16:47,339 --> 00:16:49,740
something Ctrl R Loop cut can never go

521
00:16:49,740 --> 00:16:52,079
wrong just add some more detail there

522
00:16:52,079 --> 00:16:55,019
and I should probably LL to select the

523
00:16:55,019 --> 00:16:56,940
link here move this one forward and I

524
00:16:56,940 --> 00:16:58,259
think I'm going to do like some

525
00:16:58,259 --> 00:17:00,240
indentations here

526
00:17:00,240 --> 00:17:03,360
so I'll Ctrl R to Loop cut here Ctrl R

527
00:17:03,360 --> 00:17:07,020
Loop cut here Ctrl R Loop cut there Ctrl

528
00:17:07,020 --> 00:17:09,059
R Loop cut here

529
00:17:09,059 --> 00:17:10,980
and then we'll just do shift select

530
00:17:10,980 --> 00:17:12,900
these eye to inset

531
00:17:12,900 --> 00:17:15,599
alt D to extrude long face normals

532
00:17:15,599 --> 00:17:17,880
and then I'll color this one a lot

533
00:17:17,880 --> 00:17:19,260
darker

534
00:17:19,260 --> 00:17:22,020
so that looks a bit strange but I think

535
00:17:22,020 --> 00:17:24,240
it'll it'll be okay then alt select here

536
00:17:24,240 --> 00:17:27,839
scale on the z-axis and here I should do

537
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:30,900
as well maybe I want to have something

538
00:17:30,900 --> 00:17:32,820
the houses like a camera here as well

539
00:17:32,820 --> 00:17:35,400
eye to inset B for the boundary in the

540
00:17:35,400 --> 00:17:36,840
center alt e to extrude long face

541
00:17:36,840 --> 00:17:40,039
normals G get this one to a dark color

542
00:17:40,039 --> 00:17:42,780
there again and then I'm just gonna do

543
00:17:42,780 --> 00:17:44,820
some sort of a lens here so this is

544
00:17:44,820 --> 00:17:45,900
going to be a problem because I'm going

545
00:17:45,900 --> 00:17:47,640
to be actually I'll do two lenses

546
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:48,780
because that's going to be easier than

547
00:17:48,780 --> 00:17:50,880
one lens since I'm in mirror mode here

548
00:17:50,880 --> 00:17:53,460
so I'll grab this one shift d to

549
00:17:53,460 --> 00:17:56,340
duplicate it but I have to disable here

550
00:17:56,340 --> 00:17:58,799
on the modifier I have to clipping off

551
00:17:58,799 --> 00:18:01,200
so I can just move that into there

552
00:18:01,200 --> 00:18:04,080
so let's why not make two camera lenses

553
00:18:04,080 --> 00:18:06,360
here stereo yeah it's filming stereo so

554
00:18:06,360 --> 00:18:08,400
it's good for VR right right click

555
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:11,160
subdivide Circle scale it down clipping

556
00:18:11,160 --> 00:18:12,480
back on because I always forget it but

557
00:18:12,480 --> 00:18:15,360
not this time G to move it to a a

558
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:17,520
brighter gray maybe I'll do metal out of

559
00:18:17,520 --> 00:18:20,160
these later on so I'll do e to extrude

560
00:18:20,160 --> 00:18:21,720
and it's going to be failing downwards

561
00:18:21,720 --> 00:18:23,520
because this is like a surveillance one

562
00:18:23,520 --> 00:18:25,919
so surveillance why can I not say that

563
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,720
word alt the extra long phase normals

564
00:18:27,720 --> 00:18:31,200
again uh each extrude estas scale each

565
00:18:31,200 --> 00:18:34,140
extrude and I to inset and e to extrude

566
00:18:34,140 --> 00:18:36,840
it looks looks like a pair of binoculars

567
00:18:36,840 --> 00:18:38,220
why not

568
00:18:38,220 --> 00:18:40,320
so should we do like a focus ring as

569
00:18:40,320 --> 00:18:43,020
well automated of course so iTunes that

570
00:18:43,020 --> 00:18:46,020
all tested scale and Control Plus and do

571
00:18:46,020 --> 00:18:47,700
that a little bit darker as well and

572
00:18:47,700 --> 00:18:49,500
then grab this one

573
00:18:49,500 --> 00:18:51,600
and I forgot to press X and do limited

574
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:54,120
dissolve each extrude that's the scale B

575
00:18:54,120 --> 00:18:56,760
to extrude looks a bit quirky it looks

576
00:18:56,760 --> 00:18:58,559
like a pair of binoculars this turned

577
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,059
out to be like a comical one instead but

578
00:19:00,059 --> 00:19:01,620
let's go for it

579
00:19:01,620 --> 00:19:03,600
I've got three minutes to go so I'll

580
00:19:03,600 --> 00:19:06,179
just add some quirky details here maybe

581
00:19:06,179 --> 00:19:07,980
something like this and I think I'm

582
00:19:07,980 --> 00:19:10,020
gonna add a pair of eyes for navigation

583
00:19:10,020 --> 00:19:11,940
as well this is gonna be more like the

584
00:19:11,940 --> 00:19:15,720
uh the stuff that it uses to navigate I

585
00:19:15,720 --> 00:19:17,940
think alt e to extrude because we make

586
00:19:17,940 --> 00:19:19,320
can make these shine a little bit

587
00:19:19,320 --> 00:19:22,799
instead so I'll do scale this one down

588
00:19:22,799 --> 00:19:24,960
okay no I don't want to do that GG to

589
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:27,780
slide it down

590
00:19:27,780 --> 00:19:29,820
gee okay I'll have to just Freebase this

591
00:19:29,820 --> 00:19:31,620
one a bit it's not called Freebase I

592
00:19:31,620 --> 00:19:33,840
don't know it's called free free freebie

593
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,400
or something

594
00:19:35,400 --> 00:19:37,380
okay that's no good but I'll do like

595
00:19:37,380 --> 00:19:40,020
this and I know I'm twisting the

596
00:19:40,020 --> 00:19:41,700
polygons now probably a big time but

597
00:19:41,700 --> 00:19:43,080
never mind

598
00:19:43,080 --> 00:19:47,400
still gonna do it g g and GG to slide

599
00:19:47,400 --> 00:19:49,200
this one and now I'm just gonna do eye

600
00:19:49,200 --> 00:19:51,840
to inset and ALT D to extreme long face

601
00:19:51,840 --> 00:19:54,360
normals scale that one down and this one

602
00:19:54,360 --> 00:19:57,059
we can go and miss it right so

603
00:19:57,059 --> 00:19:59,460
should we do like green eyes I think or

604
00:19:59,460 --> 00:20:02,700
red probably evil red eyes there we go

605
00:20:02,700 --> 00:20:04,799
and then I still got two minutes to go

606
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,120
so we have to do something about this

607
00:20:06,120 --> 00:20:09,299
hideous top here and fins can never go

608
00:20:09,299 --> 00:20:12,120
wrong uh unless you're from Sweden then

609
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:14,280
fins are not

610
00:20:14,280 --> 00:20:15,960
well they're neighboring countries so

611
00:20:15,960 --> 00:20:19,080
it's pretty cool uh we'll do comma scale

612
00:20:19,080 --> 00:20:22,860
Y and scale why well I said why but I

613
00:20:22,860 --> 00:20:25,080
did X so

614
00:20:25,080 --> 00:20:27,539
ete extrude and Esther scale and I'm

615
00:20:27,539 --> 00:20:29,100
running out of time so I'll just have to

616
00:20:29,100 --> 00:20:30,840
put some stuff here now

617
00:20:30,840 --> 00:20:32,820
so here's going to be some sort of a

618
00:20:32,820 --> 00:20:33,840
hatch

619
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,539
we'll do actually should I do this way I

620
00:20:36,539 --> 00:20:38,940
to inset alt D to extrude long face

621
00:20:38,940 --> 00:20:42,720
normals scale it down and move it okay

622
00:20:42,720 --> 00:20:45,780
pick comma again in global move it in

623
00:20:45,780 --> 00:20:49,440
and then I'll just go darker

624
00:20:49,440 --> 00:20:50,880
to there

625
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:52,559
and then we'll put some stuff as well

626
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:55,380
some exhaust here or something no just a

627
00:20:55,380 --> 00:20:56,700
hatch here

628
00:20:56,700 --> 00:20:58,799
no that doesn't work either

629
00:20:58,799 --> 00:21:03,320
so I'll do what should we do

630
00:21:04,380 --> 00:21:06,600
Okay iTunes that I'll just wing it a

631
00:21:06,600 --> 00:21:08,940
little bit now that doesn't work either

632
00:21:08,940 --> 00:21:11,460
because that one's messed up GG

633
00:21:11,460 --> 00:21:13,860
iTunes set all tests to scale I'll do

634
00:21:13,860 --> 00:21:17,100
some armor plating that should do

635
00:21:17,100 --> 00:21:19,860
so itin set all tests to scale this

636
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:21,960
creates like a panel effect look

637
00:21:21,960 --> 00:21:25,020
um we can just do it inset eat extrude

638
00:21:25,020 --> 00:21:27,419
as the scale this is some sort of a

639
00:21:27,419 --> 00:21:30,059
housing of something I've got 45 seconds

640
00:21:30,059 --> 00:21:31,679
so I'm just going to add some fake

641
00:21:31,679 --> 00:21:34,140
details here I guess or something under

642
00:21:34,140 --> 00:21:36,659
here as well here's like a hatch where

643
00:21:36,659 --> 00:21:38,280
you can pick things up you need to

644
00:21:38,280 --> 00:21:40,740
extrude maybe quite a lot there

645
00:21:40,740 --> 00:21:45,419
there we'll do eye to insect alt tests

646
00:21:45,419 --> 00:21:48,179
iTunes that here's some sort of an air

647
00:21:48,179 --> 00:21:50,400
intake or something you don't have air

648
00:21:50,400 --> 00:21:52,380
intakes all the time but never mind and

649
00:21:52,380 --> 00:21:56,039
here is something else I10 set we'll

650
00:21:56,039 --> 00:21:58,980
just do this one it instead he took

651
00:21:58,980 --> 00:22:00,539
extrude s to scale

652
00:22:00,539 --> 00:22:03,299
g e to extrude S to scale these are some

653
00:22:03,299 --> 00:22:06,360
like sensors or something uh height

654
00:22:06,360 --> 00:22:07,440
inset

655
00:22:07,440 --> 00:22:09,900
need to extrude as the scale

656
00:22:09,900 --> 00:22:14,400
key to move and two seconds

657
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:15,960
i e

658
00:22:15,960 --> 00:22:17,039
okay

659
00:22:17,039 --> 00:22:19,900
it's basically not sounding well

660
00:22:19,900 --> 00:22:22,989
[Music]

661
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:26,039
why do I always make this one there we

662
00:22:26,039 --> 00:22:29,460
go all right so here's the Drone in 10

663
00:22:29,460 --> 00:22:31,260
minutes it's got

664
00:22:31,260 --> 00:22:33,299
you could rig it and have these things

665
00:22:33,299 --> 00:22:34,860
flap about I think it looks a little bit

666
00:22:34,860 --> 00:22:36,840
comical with these binoculars there

667
00:22:36,840 --> 00:22:38,820
we'll go into Tinker Time now since this

668
00:22:38,820 --> 00:22:40,200
is the last episode of the 10 minute

669
00:22:40,200 --> 00:22:42,780
long challenge in this room I'll just uh

670
00:22:42,780 --> 00:22:44,760
do a little tweak version as well I

671
00:22:44,760 --> 00:22:46,380
think I'm gonna try

672
00:22:46,380 --> 00:22:48,720
to change all of this

673
00:22:48,720 --> 00:22:50,580
if I scale

674
00:22:50,580 --> 00:22:54,000
scale it on the x-axis first to zero

675
00:22:54,000 --> 00:22:56,700
okay that was no good here

676
00:22:56,700 --> 00:23:00,059
scale X zero and then I'm going to try

677
00:23:00,059 --> 00:23:01,620
to move it down now to shiny metal

678
00:23:01,620 --> 00:23:03,299
instead

679
00:23:03,299 --> 00:23:05,820
and then I have to scale it down again

680
00:23:05,820 --> 00:23:08,640
and move it to here is this better or

681
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:11,059
worse

682
00:23:12,179 --> 00:23:14,760
I think I'm going to keep it to the well

683
00:23:14,760 --> 00:23:16,860
maybe it's too shiny actually but should

684
00:23:16,860 --> 00:23:18,539
I bring it to a little a little bit

685
00:23:18,539 --> 00:23:21,480
duller here that one might be good

686
00:23:21,480 --> 00:23:24,679
think I prefer this

687
00:23:25,440 --> 00:23:27,240
and then we can put some more controls

688
00:23:27,240 --> 00:23:28,320
here from above it's going to be

689
00:23:28,320 --> 00:23:30,299
vulnerable so e to extrude

690
00:23:30,299 --> 00:23:32,460
s to scale and here I can just do right

691
00:23:32,460 --> 00:23:34,200
click subdivide

692
00:23:34,200 --> 00:23:36,059
let's go up with the subdivision a bit

693
00:23:36,059 --> 00:23:38,460
like this and then I'll just do some

694
00:23:38,460 --> 00:23:39,600
random

695
00:23:39,600 --> 00:23:41,880
configurations here

696
00:23:41,880 --> 00:23:43,679
where we can put

697
00:23:43,679 --> 00:23:44,760
here

698
00:23:44,760 --> 00:23:48,120
some cyan

699
00:23:48,120 --> 00:23:50,039
blue lights

700
00:23:50,039 --> 00:23:52,260
so some control points there or

701
00:23:52,260 --> 00:23:53,520
something

702
00:23:53,520 --> 00:23:55,620
this one could be red

703
00:23:55,620 --> 00:23:57,600
the little one don't press the red

704
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,039
button

705
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:02,100
so that could have been none and maybe I

706
00:24:02,100 --> 00:24:04,440
could have put some like Stripes here as

707
00:24:04,440 --> 00:24:06,000
well

708
00:24:06,000 --> 00:24:09,659
so GG slides it remember very handy

709
00:24:09,659 --> 00:24:12,000
eye to inset all tests to extreme long

710
00:24:12,000 --> 00:24:14,100
phase normal so I think I'll indent this

711
00:24:14,100 --> 00:24:16,760
slightly

712
00:24:17,520 --> 00:24:19,320
should we

713
00:24:19,320 --> 00:24:21,659
no I'll just color it then

714
00:24:21,659 --> 00:24:25,080
so instead here I'll put like a

715
00:24:25,080 --> 00:24:28,820
an orange color on it maybe

716
00:24:29,820 --> 00:24:30,900
there

717
00:24:30,900 --> 00:24:33,919
I don't know if I like that

718
00:24:34,020 --> 00:24:36,900
control r s

719
00:24:36,900 --> 00:24:40,320
Ctrl r s

720
00:24:40,320 --> 00:24:42,299
I think that's a little bit better look

721
00:24:42,299 --> 00:24:43,620
to it

722
00:24:43,620 --> 00:24:46,020
and maybe it should have been here as

723
00:24:46,020 --> 00:24:49,559
well maybe we can put it inset

724
00:24:49,559 --> 00:24:53,059
bring that to Orange as well

725
00:24:53,940 --> 00:24:55,980
just some colorization on it no that

726
00:24:55,980 --> 00:24:57,600
makes no sense either

727
00:24:57,600 --> 00:24:58,980
and I don't think it should be orange

728
00:24:58,980 --> 00:25:01,020
there because the thing is I'll put it

729
00:25:01,020 --> 00:25:03,299
on red instead

730
00:25:03,299 --> 00:25:07,280
it's like a mark a red mark one

731
00:25:09,059 --> 00:25:11,880
and I think just for some to break up

732
00:25:11,880 --> 00:25:13,500
the colorization a bit I think I'm gonna

733
00:25:13,500 --> 00:25:16,080
grab these and change

734
00:25:16,080 --> 00:25:19,740
the color choose something a bit darker

735
00:25:19,740 --> 00:25:22,200
and then I think I might do that

736
00:25:22,200 --> 00:25:24,840
blades

737
00:25:24,840 --> 00:25:29,240
brighter so l l

738
00:25:29,760 --> 00:25:31,919
there we go and let's make those like a

739
00:25:31,919 --> 00:25:34,580
really bright metal

740
00:25:39,779 --> 00:25:42,659
and these lenses I guess we could do X

741
00:25:42,659 --> 00:25:45,000
and do limited dissolve and then I'll

742
00:25:45,000 --> 00:25:47,940
slap them slap slap

743
00:25:47,940 --> 00:25:51,600
them onto hello where are you

744
00:25:51,600 --> 00:25:54,000
here really shiny but you might not be

745
00:25:54,000 --> 00:25:56,900
able to see that anyway

746
00:25:57,500 --> 00:25:59,159
sorry

747
00:25:59,159 --> 00:26:01,320
and should we put some antennas here as

748
00:26:01,320 --> 00:26:02,820
well

749
00:26:02,820 --> 00:26:04,320
I think so

750
00:26:04,320 --> 00:26:06,360
so how do we do antennas well you know

751
00:26:06,360 --> 00:26:08,760
it shift a to duplicate move it up so we

752
00:26:08,760 --> 00:26:10,860
can see it right click subdivide and

753
00:26:10,860 --> 00:26:12,720
circle scale it down

754
00:26:12,720 --> 00:26:14,760
bring it down again

755
00:26:14,760 --> 00:26:18,299
and do move it there e to extrude S to

756
00:26:18,299 --> 00:26:21,059
scale e to extrude e to extrude S to

757
00:26:21,059 --> 00:26:22,380
scale I might actually keep the lights

758
00:26:22,380 --> 00:26:24,059
on the top there

759
00:26:24,059 --> 00:26:26,880
but I will move the colors here

760
00:26:26,880 --> 00:26:30,840
to like just some plain gray there

761
00:26:30,840 --> 00:26:34,279
and maybe this one as well

762
00:26:36,059 --> 00:26:38,880
there we go eight select everything and

763
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:41,820
then just move them to

764
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:44,820
different color here as well

765
00:26:44,820 --> 00:26:46,740
and I think I'm gonna do it a bit

766
00:26:46,740 --> 00:26:49,279
brighter actually

767
00:26:49,980 --> 00:26:52,500
so there's our antennas and

768
00:26:52,500 --> 00:26:54,840
it's gonna broadcast the signals back

769
00:26:54,840 --> 00:26:56,760
here now

770
00:26:56,760 --> 00:26:58,740
should I put more antennas on Shifty to

771
00:26:58,740 --> 00:27:00,120
duplicate

772
00:27:00,120 --> 00:27:01,740
scale

773
00:27:01,740 --> 00:27:04,279
G

774
00:27:04,320 --> 00:27:08,220
forward a bit no that's good

775
00:27:08,220 --> 00:27:10,020
and maybe some sort of an exhaust here

776
00:27:10,020 --> 00:27:12,360
as well item set

777
00:27:12,360 --> 00:27:15,960
heat extrude and then we'll do another

778
00:27:15,960 --> 00:27:18,360
round thing here shift a to duplicate

779
00:27:18,360 --> 00:27:19,799
move it

780
00:27:19,799 --> 00:27:23,340
right click subdivide Circle scale it

781
00:27:23,340 --> 00:27:26,580
bring it scale it

782
00:27:26,580 --> 00:27:28,860
G to move it down

783
00:27:28,860 --> 00:27:31,260
each extrude

784
00:27:31,260 --> 00:27:33,600
G to move rotate

785
00:27:33,600 --> 00:27:37,140
scale quite not scary though

786
00:27:37,140 --> 00:27:39,059
we'll scale the whole thing down scale

787
00:27:39,059 --> 00:27:41,039
he's a bit twisted but I'm okay with

788
00:27:41,039 --> 00:27:45,299
that rotate on the x-axis

789
00:27:45,299 --> 00:27:49,740
G and then just gonna do it inset and E

790
00:27:49,740 --> 00:27:52,320
to extrude S to scale

791
00:27:52,320 --> 00:27:54,000
Control Plus and these will just do

792
00:27:54,000 --> 00:27:55,679
non-reflective

793
00:27:55,679 --> 00:27:58,400
black here

794
00:28:02,400 --> 00:28:04,620
so I don't know if it runs I guess it's

795
00:28:04,620 --> 00:28:08,159
running on uh electricity but it looks

796
00:28:08,159 --> 00:28:10,559
like it might be on petrol this one

797
00:28:10,559 --> 00:28:12,419
they save their moments with some petrol

798
00:28:12,419 --> 00:28:14,400
using so

799
00:28:14,400 --> 00:28:18,179
I don't know what to do I change that

800
00:28:18,179 --> 00:28:23,059
and it's extrude and I think that's it

801
00:28:25,320 --> 00:28:27,120
so with some additional time there we

802
00:28:27,120 --> 00:28:29,220
had a few more things you could like

803
00:28:29,220 --> 00:28:31,919
create some claw things as well maybe or

804
00:28:31,919 --> 00:28:34,740
some more armor plates I'd inset all

805
00:28:34,740 --> 00:28:36,840
testes scale

806
00:28:36,840 --> 00:28:41,039
height inset all test to scale and here

807
00:28:41,039 --> 00:28:44,640
one more thing eye to inset and

808
00:28:44,640 --> 00:28:47,100
alt e to extrude long face normals

809
00:28:47,100 --> 00:28:48,960
Control Plus

810
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:51,240
and then just do this one a and then

811
00:28:51,240 --> 00:28:54,000
dollar and darker

812
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:55,620
and obviously you'd have to make them

813
00:28:55,620 --> 00:28:58,140
spin if you wanted in the game

814
00:28:58,140 --> 00:29:00,720
alright folks so there we have it a

815
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,220
drone to go with the weekly modeling

816
00:29:02,220 --> 00:29:03,659
challenge if you want to join in on the

817
00:29:03,659 --> 00:29:04,799
weekly modeling challenge if you don't

818
00:29:04,799 --> 00:29:06,120
know what to model if you want to boost

819
00:29:06,120 --> 00:29:07,860
your skills and improve yourself share

820
00:29:07,860 --> 00:29:09,480
your work and get some feedback from

821
00:29:09,480 --> 00:29:11,640
some Discord members lovely Discord

822
00:29:11,640 --> 00:29:13,799

talk about all sorts of random things

826
00:29:19,020 --> 00:29:20,820
about modeling or game development or

827
00:29:20,820 --> 00:29:23,039
watches play games or share our work

828
00:29:23,039 --> 00:29:24,779
when we stream a little bit there just

829
00:29:24,779 --> 00:29:26,520

little bit with us and we'll have a good

832
00:29:29,940 --> 00:29:31,980
time speaking about these type of things

833
00:29:31,980 --> 00:29:34,020
all right so with that said I'm gonna be

834
00:29:34,020 --> 00:29:35,340
summing up this video I'm going to be

835
00:29:35,340 --> 00:29:37,320
uploading this model here to my patreon

836
00:29:37,320 --> 00:29:39,659
page to the tutorial tier they will be

837
00:29:39,659 --> 00:29:41,880
getting a hold of all of the stuff that

838
00:29:41,880 --> 00:29:43,020
I make in the 10 minute modeling

839
00:29:43,020 --> 00:29:44,880
challenge so head over there I do it in

840
00:29:44,880 --> 00:29:46,080
batches so it's not going to come out

841
00:29:46,080 --> 00:29:48,240
right away I'll do like about 10 at a

842
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:50,220
time when I do upload them so I hope you

843
00:29:50,220 --> 00:29:51,720
enjoyed the video and subscribe if you

844
00:29:51,720 --> 00:29:53,640
haven't already and give it a like as

845
00:29:53,640 --> 00:29:55,080
well if you don't mind that'll help me

846
00:29:55,080 --> 00:29:57,899
