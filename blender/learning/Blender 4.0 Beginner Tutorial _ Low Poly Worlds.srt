00:00:00,240 --> 00:00:02,000
hey everyone it's steve here from cg

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,080
geek and i'm back again for the msi

3
00:00:04,080 --> 00:00:07,200
creator awards 2022 contest i'm a judge

4
00:00:07,200 --> 00:00:09,599
for the 3d creation category the theme

5
00:00:09,599 --> 00:00:12,080
is create your own utopia and you have

6
00:00:12,080 --> 00:00:14,719
till the end of may may 30th to get your

7
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,560
submissions in is a ton of fun and you

8
00:00:16,560 --> 00:00:18,240
can win some incredible prizes so you'll

9
00:00:18,240 --> 00:00:19,840
definitely want to enter so today i'll

10
00:00:19,840 --> 00:00:21,119
be teaching you how to create your own

11
00:00:21,119 --> 00:00:24,320
utopia low poly world using blender and

12
00:00:24,320 --> 00:00:26,560
cycles and for this project msi sent

13
00:00:26,560 --> 00:00:30,000
over their rtx 3090 supreme x really the

14
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:32,640
coolest 3090 available on the market

15
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,800
right now it's got the triple fan cooler

16
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:37,120
so it keeps the 3090 temps really low

17
00:00:37,120 --> 00:00:39,120
while being really quiet and also just

18
00:00:39,120 --> 00:00:41,600
looking super cool with the rgb lighting

19
00:00:41,600 --> 00:00:43,280
so that's the gpu i'm using and as you

20
00:00:43,280 --> 00:00:45,039
can imagine it's incredibly fast in

21
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,440
blender 3.0 now with optics without

22
00:00:47,440 --> 00:00:49,360
further ado pull up a chair sit back and

23
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,039
relax and let's have some fun creating

24
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,800
some low poly worlds so go ahead and

25
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:54,320
fire up the latest version of blender

26
00:00:54,320 --> 00:00:55,920
and let's go ahead and start creating

27
00:00:55,920 --> 00:00:57,680
our world so we'll start by just scaling

28
00:00:57,680 --> 00:00:59,520
our cube up about three times by hitting

29
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,960
s and three and then i'm going to scale

30
00:01:00,960 --> 00:01:02,879
it down along these z axis by hitting s

31
00:01:02,879 --> 00:01:05,360
and z so we have a platform for our low

32
00:01:05,360 --> 00:01:06,799
poly world here this is just the base

33
00:01:06,799 --> 00:01:07,840
ground so we'll go ahead and give it a

34
00:01:07,840 --> 00:01:09,680
material right off the bat why not this

35
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,520
will just be a nice brownish color and

36
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:12,799
start rendering right off the bat by

37
00:01:12,799 --> 00:01:14,240
jumping to the rendered view here and

38
00:01:14,240 --> 00:01:16,400
we'll switch that over from ev to cycles

39
00:01:16,400 --> 00:01:18,080
and then change the device to gpu

40
00:01:18,080 --> 00:01:20,799
compute so i'm using that rtx 3090 for

41
00:01:20,799 --> 00:01:22,320
all the rendering here also i'll go

42
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:23,920
ahead and open up my hdr lighting right

43
00:01:23,920 --> 00:01:25,200
away for the scene so everything looks

44
00:01:25,200 --> 00:01:26,799
nice and pretty in real time as we're

45
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,080
rendering it so i'm just opening up an

46
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,920
hdr here from poly haven i'm going to

47
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:31,759
take the strength down this a bit just

48
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:34,000
to a 0.5 and then i'm going to jump to

49
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,840
the render settings here and if you go

50
00:01:35,840 --> 00:01:38,400
down to film you can check transparent

51
00:01:38,400 --> 00:01:39,759
so you don't see that in the background

52
00:01:39,759 --> 00:01:41,119
but it's adding some lighting to the

53
00:01:41,119 --> 00:01:42,560
scene making it look prettier all right

54
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,720
so now with a nice sort of brownish

55
00:01:44,720 --> 00:01:46,399
color here for our ground maybe make it

56
00:01:46,399 --> 00:01:48,079
a little bit darker as well

57
00:01:48,079 --> 00:01:49,680
we can go ahead and start working on the

58
00:01:49,680 --> 00:01:50,960
ground so i'm going to tap into edit

59
00:01:50,960 --> 00:01:52,560
mode i'm going to grab a vertice here

60
00:01:52,560 --> 00:01:54,399
and then hit l on my keyboard to select

61
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:57,360
the whole cube i'll hit shift d and pull

62
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:59,280
it up along the z axis now i'm going to

63
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:01,360
scale it along the shift z by hitting

64
00:02:01,360 --> 00:02:03,680
shift and z to make it wider but not

65
00:02:03,680 --> 00:02:05,280
taller and then we'll scale it down

66
00:02:05,280 --> 00:02:06,719
along this head a little bit as well as

67
00:02:06,719 --> 00:02:08,318
well because it's a little tall there

68
00:02:08,318 --> 00:02:09,758
that's looking pretty good now i'm going

69
00:02:09,758 --> 00:02:11,920
to go ahead and go ctrl r to add in an

70
00:02:11,920 --> 00:02:13,760
edge loop on both sides here and then

71
00:02:13,760 --> 00:02:15,599
i'll grab the rest of the mesh here

72
00:02:15,599 --> 00:02:18,000
right click and subdivide it perfect now

73
00:02:18,000 --> 00:02:20,080
i'll hit l to select that top mesh and

74
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:22,080
i'll hit ctrl t on my keyboard to

75
00:02:22,080 --> 00:02:23,840
triangulate the mesh this is gonna help

76
00:02:23,840 --> 00:02:25,760
make it look nice and low poly now if i

77
00:02:25,760 --> 00:02:27,599
hit o to enable proportional editing

78
00:02:27,599 --> 00:02:28,959
here you can see that if i choose

79
00:02:28,959 --> 00:02:30,879
connected only i can grab some of these

80
00:02:30,879 --> 00:02:33,519
vertices and start pulling up sections

81
00:02:33,519 --> 00:02:34,720
of the mesh here to make it look like we

82
00:02:34,720 --> 00:02:36,480
have some sort of hills and valleys

83
00:02:36,480 --> 00:02:38,640
going along on our mesh here just give

84
00:02:38,640 --> 00:02:40,000
it a little bit of an organic sort of

85
00:02:40,000 --> 00:02:42,160
look to make it look like up and down

86
00:02:42,160 --> 00:02:43,440
giving us some of that variation so you

87
00:02:43,440 --> 00:02:45,280
see some of those faces

88
00:02:45,280 --> 00:02:46,480
sticking up

89
00:02:46,480 --> 00:02:48,720
nicely not bad at all and on the ground

90
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:50,239
here i'm going to turn the roughness all

91
00:02:50,239 --> 00:02:52,239
the way up to 1 so it's not shiny

92
00:02:52,239 --> 00:02:54,319
perfect now we can make a new material

93
00:02:54,319 --> 00:02:57,040
this one will be a nice green color

94
00:02:57,040 --> 00:02:59,360
something along the lines of this

95
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,200
here and then if you tab in edit mode

96
00:03:01,200 --> 00:03:03,200
hit l to select just the top mesh there

97
00:03:03,200 --> 00:03:05,120
and assign it because we have our new

98
00:03:05,120 --> 00:03:06,239
color

99
00:03:06,239 --> 00:03:08,159
in the scene again we're going to take

100
00:03:08,159 --> 00:03:09,920
the roughness down on the grass so just

101
00:03:09,920 --> 00:03:11,760
give that a one play around the color a

102
00:03:11,760 --> 00:03:13,920
little bit to get the right color that

103
00:03:13,920 --> 00:03:15,120
you kind of go on for the scene maybe a

104
00:03:15,120 --> 00:03:16,480
little darker

105
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:18,159
alright now we want to cut a river

106
00:03:18,159 --> 00:03:20,000
through the center of this

107
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:22,000
and this actually isn't too hard to do

108
00:03:22,000 --> 00:03:23,200
what i'm going to do is i'm going to

109
00:03:23,200 --> 00:03:25,200
jump to top view i'm going to go shift a

110
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,680
and add in a cube this is going to be

111
00:03:27,680 --> 00:03:29,440
the size of the river that we want to

112
00:03:29,440 --> 00:03:31,120
cut through here so i'm going to hit g

113
00:03:31,120 --> 00:03:33,840
pull it up along the z axis there and

114
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:36,720
i'll hit s and x to scale it along the

115
00:03:36,720 --> 00:03:38,319
x-axis

116
00:03:38,319 --> 00:03:39,680
and this is going to basically be where

117
00:03:39,680 --> 00:03:41,840
the river is cut out of my scene so i

118
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:44,319
can tab in edit mode put a few cuts in

119
00:03:44,319 --> 00:03:45,680
this cube

120
00:03:45,680 --> 00:03:47,200
and then grab those verses and just give

121
00:03:47,200 --> 00:03:48,799
them a little bit of side to side

122
00:03:48,799 --> 00:03:50,640
movement so the creek here or the stream

123
00:03:50,640 --> 00:03:51,760
or whatever you want to call it isn't

124
00:03:51,760 --> 00:03:53,200
perfectly straight make it look a little

125
00:03:53,200 --> 00:03:55,280
bit more organic and then we'll grab our

126
00:03:55,280 --> 00:03:57,360
ground mesh here jump to the modifier

127
00:03:57,360 --> 00:03:59,040
settings and go ahead and add in a

128
00:03:59,040 --> 00:04:00,560
boolean modifier

129
00:04:00,560 --> 00:04:02,799
we're gonna grab the object of that cube

130
00:04:02,799 --> 00:04:05,200
as long as it's set to difference and

131
00:04:05,200 --> 00:04:07,040
fast you can see that if i hide this

132
00:04:07,040 --> 00:04:10,159
cube now we have a nice river cut out of

133
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,080
our creek and that looks really good you

134
00:04:12,080 --> 00:04:13,840
can grab your cube object here and kind

135
00:04:13,840 --> 00:04:15,519
of play around with it to choose where

136
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:18,000
you want that to be exactly how deep you

137
00:04:18,000 --> 00:04:19,759
want the creek to be etc but it's really

138
00:04:19,759 --> 00:04:21,279
easy to mess around with

139
00:04:21,279 --> 00:04:22,560
and once you have something that you

140
00:04:22,560 --> 00:04:24,080
think looks pretty good i'm just hiding

141
00:04:24,080 --> 00:04:25,440
the mesh there i'll go ahead and click

142
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:27,600
the drop down there and click apply for

143
00:04:27,600 --> 00:04:29,280
that boolean modifier now you might want

144
00:04:29,280 --> 00:04:30,720
to hit three in the keyboard to switch

145
00:04:30,720 --> 00:04:32,639
to face select and grab all those faces

146
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,000
in the middle and just make sure that

147
00:04:34,000 --> 00:04:35,600
those are all assigned to the green

148
00:04:35,600 --> 00:04:36,880
material as well i just thought that

149
00:04:36,880 --> 00:04:38,320
looked a little bit better and we'll go

150
00:04:38,320 --> 00:04:40,160
ahead and add in our creak now running

151
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:42,080
across the center of our scene so for

152
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
this it's just going to be a plane

153
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:46,160
scale it down a little bit

154
00:04:46,160 --> 00:04:48,479
grab it along the z-axis and we'll scale

155
00:04:48,479 --> 00:04:51,360
it along the x-axis

156
00:04:51,360 --> 00:04:53,040
something like that looks pretty good

157
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,720
then i'll tab into edit mode grab the

158
00:04:54,720 --> 00:04:56,720
two vertices on the end here and i'll

159
00:04:56,720 --> 00:04:59,199
just extrude extrude them down along the

160
00:04:59,199 --> 00:05:01,280
z axis something like so now we're going

161
00:05:01,280 --> 00:05:03,759
to want to put a cut down the middle

162
00:05:03,759 --> 00:05:05,440
cut there and then a few cuts in the

163
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,800
center by using our scroll wheel and

164
00:05:06,800 --> 00:05:08,720
going ctrl r and clicking

165
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:09,840
and this just gives us some more

166
00:05:09,840 --> 00:05:11,360
variation to make this look a little bit

167
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:13,120
more low poly a quick technique for

168
00:05:13,120 --> 00:05:14,880
doing this is using proportional editing

169
00:05:14,880 --> 00:05:17,039
but changing it to random and now if i

170
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:19,120
go g along the z and just kind of scroll

171
00:05:19,120 --> 00:05:20,800
my wheel real big you can see we kind of

172
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:23,440
get a low poly wave effect going through

173
00:05:23,440 --> 00:05:24,960
that creek i'm also going to go ahead

174
00:05:24,960 --> 00:05:27,520
now and add in a solidify modifier on

175
00:05:27,520 --> 00:05:29,120
our creek there we'll crank the

176
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:30,800
thickness up a little bit something like

177
00:05:30,800 --> 00:05:33,360
so next up we can add a material to our

178
00:05:33,360 --> 00:05:35,120
creek so i'm just going to go ahead to

179
00:05:35,120 --> 00:05:37,360
our materials tab go new material then

180
00:05:37,360 --> 00:05:38,960
i'm gonna go ahead and split our window

181
00:05:38,960 --> 00:05:40,639
so we can bring up a shader editor to

182
00:05:40,639 --> 00:05:43,120
work on this material a little bit more

183
00:05:43,120 --> 00:05:44,800
switching this window to the shader

184
00:05:44,800 --> 00:05:46,160
editor hitting end to close off the

185
00:05:46,160 --> 00:05:47,759
properties tab i'm giving it just a

186
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:49,840
little bit of a blue color here and then

187
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:51,520
i'm going to pull this principle shader

188
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:52,880
out of the way a little bit i'll give it

189
00:05:52,880 --> 00:05:54,320
more specular by cranking that all the

190
00:05:54,320 --> 00:05:56,000
way up so it's nice and shiny a little

191
00:05:56,000 --> 00:05:57,759
bit of sheen can kind of help as well by

192
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,360
adding some value there but then i'm

193
00:05:59,360 --> 00:06:01,280
going to go shift it and add in a shader

194
00:06:01,280 --> 00:06:02,960
mix shader where we have it right there

195
00:06:02,960 --> 00:06:04,000
shader

196
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:06,080
right there then i'll go shift a and add

197
00:06:06,080 --> 00:06:08,560
in a glass shader go ahead and plug this

198
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,160
into the bottom socket and you can see

199
00:06:10,160 --> 00:06:11,520
that this just gives it a little bit

200
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:13,600
more of that shiny reflectiveness that

201
00:06:13,600 --> 00:06:15,520
is looking pretty cool i'll go ahead and

202
00:06:15,520 --> 00:06:17,360
duplicate that mix shader

203
00:06:17,360 --> 00:06:18,880
and then go shift a and add in a new

204
00:06:18,880 --> 00:06:21,280
shader glossy as well we'll change this

205
00:06:21,280 --> 00:06:22,880
to sharp i'll go ahead and plug that

206
00:06:22,880 --> 00:06:24,639
into the bottom socket and this you want

207
00:06:24,639 --> 00:06:27,600
to go a less of a mix factor here but

208
00:06:27,600 --> 00:06:29,120
putting a little bit of that in there

209
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:30,560
makes it look nice and kind of like

210
00:06:30,560 --> 00:06:32,639
water as well not too bad maybe make the

211
00:06:32,639 --> 00:06:34,240
color of the water here a little bit

212
00:06:34,240 --> 00:06:36,160
more blue

213
00:06:36,160 --> 00:06:38,240
that's looking good let's grab the lamp

214
00:06:38,240 --> 00:06:39,759
that is sitting in the blender scene

215
00:06:39,759 --> 00:06:41,280
here and change it to a sun lamp we'll

216
00:06:41,280 --> 00:06:42,800
take the value down to a three actually

217
00:06:42,800 --> 00:06:44,160
and give it a little bit of a warmer

218
00:06:44,160 --> 00:06:45,759
color but this will just be adding some

219
00:06:45,759 --> 00:06:47,600
more shadows to our scene and as you can

220
00:06:47,600 --> 00:06:49,440
see that looks

221
00:06:49,440 --> 00:06:51,039
pretty nice when we kind of have it to

222
00:06:51,039 --> 00:06:52,639
the side there then i'm going to grab

223
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,880
our water and go ctrl t just like i did

224
00:06:54,880 --> 00:06:56,560
before and add in a little bit of

225
00:06:56,560 --> 00:06:58,560
variation then to that

226
00:06:58,560 --> 00:07:00,160
and that just gives it more of that low

227
00:07:00,160 --> 00:07:01,840
poly look that i was talking about and

228
00:07:01,840 --> 00:07:03,039
that's looking pretty good you can go

229
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:04,000
ahead and play around with some of these

230
00:07:04,000 --> 00:07:05,840
vertices to give your ground a little

231
00:07:05,840 --> 00:07:08,319
bit of variation okay so next up let's

232
00:07:08,319 --> 00:07:10,639
go ahead and add some low poly trees to

233
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,000
the scene so i'll start off with some

234
00:07:12,000 --> 00:07:13,599
pine trees over on the side here and

235
00:07:13,599 --> 00:07:15,360
these are super easy i'm just going to

236
00:07:15,360 --> 00:07:17,360
shift right click to put my cursor over

237
00:07:17,360 --> 00:07:20,080
there shift a add in a cube we'll scale

238
00:07:20,080 --> 00:07:22,880
the cube way down i'll hit period on my

239
00:07:22,880 --> 00:07:24,800
number pad to zoom in on that cube tab

240
00:07:24,800 --> 00:07:26,639
in edit mode and then hit 3 to make sure

241
00:07:26,639 --> 00:07:28,160
i'm using face select so i can just grab

242
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:30,319
the top face there i'm going to hit e to

243
00:07:30,319 --> 00:07:32,639
extrude and scale it up a bit something

244
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,319
like that and then i'll hit e to extrude

245
00:07:34,319 --> 00:07:35,440
again

246
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:37,919
pull it up nice and high and scale it

247
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:40,000
down to a very small point there then

248
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:41,360
i'll hit g and pull it up a little bit

249
00:07:41,360 --> 00:07:42,960
higher there and as you can see that

250
00:07:42,960 --> 00:07:45,360
right there is a pine tree in itself and

251
00:07:45,360 --> 00:07:47,360
we can definitely go ahead and just ctrl

252
00:07:47,360 --> 00:07:49,440
r put a cut in the middle hit g to kind

253
00:07:49,440 --> 00:07:50,800
of move that to give it a little bit of

254
00:07:50,800 --> 00:07:53,360
personality ctrl t to make it um

255
00:07:53,360 --> 00:07:55,120
triangular and we'll add a little bit of

256
00:07:55,120 --> 00:07:56,560
variation to that now using the

257
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:58,720
proportional editing with the randomized

258
00:07:58,720 --> 00:08:00,160
node there and i'm just going to give it

259
00:08:00,160 --> 00:08:01,840
a new material this material will be

260
00:08:01,840 --> 00:08:03,440
sort of a nice

261
00:08:03,440 --> 00:08:05,360
shade of green a little bit off color to

262
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,879
the ground though give it another

263
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,960
material this will be just sort of a

264
00:08:08,960 --> 00:08:12,319
brown color for the uh for the bark on

265
00:08:12,319 --> 00:08:14,560
the trunk of that tree so you can tab in

266
00:08:14,560 --> 00:08:16,000
edit mode here

267
00:08:16,000 --> 00:08:17,759
hit three to go to face select and

268
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,120
actually if you check the x-ray button

269
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:20,800
here we can see the faces on the other

270
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:22,639
side let's grab all those faces and

271
00:08:22,639 --> 00:08:25,199
assign the bark to those so there's a

272
00:08:25,199 --> 00:08:27,280
cute little tree if i ever did c1 now we

273
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:28,560
can go ahead and make some variations of

274
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:29,440
this pine tree so i'm just going to

275
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,360
rotate that pine tree so now let's make

276
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:33,279
another variation of our pine tree here

277
00:08:33,279 --> 00:08:34,640
for this i'm just going to go ahead and

278
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:36,799
add in another cube very similar to

279
00:08:36,799 --> 00:08:38,559
before scale it down nice and small for

280
00:08:38,559 --> 00:08:41,120
the trunk tab in edit mode grab that top

281
00:08:41,120 --> 00:08:43,839
face extrude scale it

282
00:08:43,839 --> 00:08:46,320
and then extrude up and scale it to a

283
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:47,600
point again

284
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:48,640
now what i'm going to do is i'm going to

285
00:08:48,640 --> 00:08:50,720
go ctrl r

286
00:08:50,720 --> 00:08:52,720
i will go down about here and i'm going

287
00:08:52,720 --> 00:08:54,800
to scale it in a bit then i'm going to

288
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:56,320
ctrl r and we'll pull this edge loop

289
00:08:56,320 --> 00:08:58,000
down i'm going to scale this one up a

290
00:08:58,000 --> 00:08:59,440
bit and as you can see right away this

291
00:08:59,440 --> 00:09:01,839
is super easy to add that kind of pine

292
00:09:01,839 --> 00:09:04,240
tree look to the scene control r again

293
00:09:04,240 --> 00:09:06,160
and i'll actually grab the first one

294
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,519
there scale that down and we have sort

295
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,279
of a cute looking pine tree not bad at

296
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:13,519
all we can go ahead and slap on our own

297
00:09:13,519 --> 00:09:15,040
sort of pine color for this one this

298
00:09:15,040 --> 00:09:16,240
should be like a little bit more of a

299
00:09:16,240 --> 00:09:17,279
bluish

300
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,200
bluish color pine tree i think that

301
00:09:19,200 --> 00:09:21,279
looks kind of nice and then a bark

302
00:09:21,279 --> 00:09:23,200
material for the trunk there we'll go

303
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:24,480
ahead and put plus so we can just grab

304
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:26,560
the same same brown material we already

305
00:09:26,560 --> 00:09:28,240
created there and assign that

306
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,000
to that so now on top view you go ahead

307
00:09:30,000 --> 00:09:31,920
and duplicate this pine tree rotating it

308
00:09:31,920 --> 00:09:33,600
around and adding in you know just a few

309
00:09:33,600 --> 00:09:35,680
variations of it

310
00:09:35,680 --> 00:09:36,959
maybe make this one scaled down a little

311
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,560
bit but then shift s along with zed to

312
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,320
make it sort of short and fat

313
00:09:40,320 --> 00:09:42,320
this one could be a little bit taller

314
00:09:42,320 --> 00:09:46,240
just kind of forming our low poly utopia

315
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,760
now i think it's time we place our

316
00:09:47,760 --> 00:09:49,279
camera so i'm going to grab our camera

317
00:09:49,279 --> 00:09:51,120
and i'm going to jump to side view here

318
00:09:51,120 --> 00:09:52,640
where i think a good angle is i'm going

319
00:09:52,640 --> 00:09:55,440
to go alt control 0 to snap it to that

320
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:57,600
view just go ahead and place it there by

321
00:09:57,600 --> 00:10:00,080
hitting g and moving over and i think it

322
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:01,600
looks best for a low poly scene like

323
00:10:01,600 --> 00:10:04,000
this to have a very zoomed in view so

324
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:05,279
i'm gonna actually change our focal

325
00:10:05,279 --> 00:10:07,120
length here under the camera settings to

326
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:09,200
200 millimeters and then i'm just gonna

327
00:10:09,200 --> 00:10:11,440
have to hit g and pull out using the

328
00:10:11,440 --> 00:10:13,680
middle mouse button to zoom that out a

329
00:10:13,680 --> 00:10:16,560
bit so we have everything in the scene

330
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,079
as we can see there perfect

331
00:10:20,079 --> 00:10:21,519
now you might be able to scale up some

332
00:10:21,519 --> 00:10:22,880
of your pine trees if things are looking

333
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:24,800
a little bit small in scale for your

334
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:27,200
liking and that's looking pretty cute i

335
00:10:27,200 --> 00:10:29,519
think on to the next part of our low

336
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,120
poly world here i'm going to go over to

337
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:32,560
the side here and we'll add in some

338
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,240
rocks these are going to be super easy

339
00:10:34,240 --> 00:10:35,920
i'm just going to add in an icosphere

340
00:10:35,920 --> 00:10:38,240
and make it one subdivision so nice and

341
00:10:38,240 --> 00:10:40,640
small here scale it down a bit and

342
00:10:40,640 --> 00:10:41,920
making sure proportional editing is

343
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:43,519
still enabled there i'm just going to go

344
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:46,560
ahead and pull up a shape here i'll grab

345
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:47,760
some of the faces along the bottom and

346
00:10:47,760 --> 00:10:50,640
i'll scale those up

347
00:10:51,440 --> 00:10:52,800
and as you can see it's really easy to

348
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:55,360
just quickly get some weird looking rock

349
00:10:55,360 --> 00:10:57,760
shapes and i can shift d duplicate that

350
00:10:57,760 --> 00:11:00,560
rotate along the z-axis here

351
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:01,920
scale it down and then using

352
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,680
proportional editing easily change the

353
00:11:03,680 --> 00:11:04,959
shape of that

354
00:11:04,959 --> 00:11:07,279
real quick for the material on these

355
00:11:07,279 --> 00:11:08,640
it's just going to be a little bit of a

356
00:11:08,640 --> 00:11:11,279
darker slightly blue color

357
00:11:11,279 --> 00:11:13,519
i'm going to go shift a and add in

358
00:11:13,519 --> 00:11:16,160
another aquasphere

359
00:11:16,160 --> 00:11:17,519
scale this one down and just scale this

360
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:20,079
one up along the z there

361
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,560
for a little bit of variation

362
00:11:22,560 --> 00:11:23,839
pull some of these faces out along the

363
00:11:23,839 --> 00:11:25,440
bottom a bit

364
00:11:25,440 --> 00:11:27,040
pull some of these down from the top and

365
00:11:27,040 --> 00:11:28,880
there we just have a cool sort of little

366
00:11:28,880 --> 00:11:31,920
bit of rock rocky formation and then we

367
00:11:31,920 --> 00:11:33,040
can go ahead and add some cute little

368
00:11:33,040 --> 00:11:34,640
pine trees around it by grabbing the

369
00:11:34,640 --> 00:11:37,600
pine tree here and shifting it

370
00:11:37,600 --> 00:11:39,279
kind of filling out our nature scene if

371
00:11:39,279 --> 00:11:40,399
you uh

372
00:11:40,399 --> 00:11:42,240
if you like

373
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:43,760
and any of these you can go ahead and

374
00:11:43,760 --> 00:11:45,760
add a little bit of variation to maybe

375
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,040
grab this little pine tree and we'll

376
00:11:47,040 --> 00:11:49,040
stick him over in this corner here with

377
00:11:49,040 --> 00:11:51,040
a little bit of a different rotation

378
00:11:51,040 --> 00:11:53,519
a little bit of an angle there maybe

379
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,639
scale

380
00:11:54,639 --> 00:11:56,240
a little bit more narrow i think i'll go

381
00:11:56,240 --> 00:11:57,839
ahead and add one more pine tree by

382
00:11:57,839 --> 00:12:00,079
duplicating this one over here maybe

383
00:12:00,079 --> 00:12:01,519
this will be a little bit bigger and

384
00:12:01,519 --> 00:12:03,040
maybe we'll give it a different color so

385
00:12:03,040 --> 00:12:04,160
we have a little bit of variation you

386
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:05,839
can just click the five button there to

387
00:12:05,839 --> 00:12:07,279
make it a separate material and then you

388
00:12:07,279 --> 00:12:09,279
can go ahead and tweak that material to

389
00:12:09,279 --> 00:12:10,639
be a little bit different

390
00:12:10,639 --> 00:12:12,800
this one will be kind of overhanging the

391
00:12:12,800 --> 00:12:14,399
overhang in the creek here a little bit

392
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:16,720
that might look kind of cute

393
00:12:16,720 --> 00:12:17,920
all right now we'll create one another

394
00:12:17,920 --> 00:12:19,920
variation of trees for this side of the

395
00:12:19,920 --> 00:12:21,600
scene here for this i'm just going to go

396
00:12:21,600 --> 00:12:24,000
ahead and add in an icosphere

397
00:12:24,000 --> 00:12:25,920
icosphere

398
00:12:25,920 --> 00:12:28,480
this one will change to two subdivisions

399
00:12:28,480 --> 00:12:31,040
pull it up scale it down

400
00:12:31,040 --> 00:12:33,120
and we'll give this a random color

401
00:12:33,120 --> 00:12:34,399
something like one of the trees that we

402
00:12:34,399 --> 00:12:36,160
already have there and for these i'm

403
00:12:36,160 --> 00:12:38,079
just going to grab it and shift d it

404
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,079
duplicate it and scale it for a

405
00:12:40,079 --> 00:12:43,040
different size we'll give this one a new

406
00:12:43,040 --> 00:12:45,040
material something like that

407
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,320
tap into edit mode and assign that new

408
00:12:46,320 --> 00:12:47,680
material to it and now you can just kind

409
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:49,200
of duplicate these icon spheres around

410
00:12:49,200 --> 00:12:51,360
to kind of make this little poly looking

411
00:12:51,360 --> 00:12:52,639
sort of

412
00:12:52,639 --> 00:12:55,200
tree sort of thing-ish

413
00:12:55,200 --> 00:12:56,800
you can get creative with this make it

414
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,440
look uh kind of abstract

415
00:12:59,440 --> 00:13:01,040
but they also kind of have their own

416
00:13:01,040 --> 00:13:04,399
unique low-poly flare to them

417
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:06,560
kind of pull it up a little bit like

418
00:13:06,560 --> 00:13:07,760
that and if you tap into edit mode you

419
00:13:07,760 --> 00:13:08,560
can also do a little bit with

420
00:13:08,560 --> 00:13:10,079
proportional editing to make them look a

421
00:13:10,079 --> 00:13:12,240
little less perfectly round so just

422
00:13:12,240 --> 00:13:13,600
giving them a little bit of that random

423
00:13:13,600 --> 00:13:15,680
proportional editing shape adds a little

424
00:13:15,680 --> 00:13:18,000
bit of that organic sort of unique look

425
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,320
to them which is kind of cool just

426
00:13:20,320 --> 00:13:21,920
moving a verse face around a little bit

427
00:13:21,920 --> 00:13:24,720
with proportional editing enabled there

428
00:13:24,720 --> 00:13:26,000
all right i think i like the look of

429
00:13:26,000 --> 00:13:27,600
that so i'll scale

430
00:13:27,600 --> 00:13:29,920
all those down a little bit

431
00:13:29,920 --> 00:13:31,440
place them over here and then you can

432
00:13:31,440 --> 00:13:34,160
hit ctrl j to make them all one object

433
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:36,000
now we need a quick quick and dirty

434
00:13:36,000 --> 00:13:37,519
trunk so what i'm going to do for this

435
00:13:37,519 --> 00:13:39,760
is with face select enabled here i'm

436
00:13:39,760 --> 00:13:41,440
just going to grab a few faces along the

437
00:13:41,440 --> 00:13:43,279
bottom of these

438
00:13:43,279 --> 00:13:45,680
there we go and i'll extrude

439
00:13:45,680 --> 00:13:47,120
and scale them down but i want to turn

440
00:13:47,120 --> 00:13:49,120
off the porcelain for this yeah scale

441
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:52,639
them down something like that

442
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:55,199
all to a central point where then i'll

443
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,639
just duplicate one of these faces by

444
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:57,839
hitting shift d

445
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,360
rotate it and scale this one up a little

446
00:13:59,360 --> 00:14:00,240
bit

447
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,360
place it right in the middle there and

448
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:02,720
extrude this down

449
00:14:02,720 --> 00:14:04,720
for the trunk of the tree now if i just

450
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,720
hit l i can select that

451
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,639
add in new material we'll give this one

452
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:10,399
the bark material there and assign it to

453
00:14:10,399 --> 00:14:12,399
it i can also grab these little faces

454
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:14,800
here hit ctrl plus with the number pad

455
00:14:14,800 --> 00:14:16,720
to increase that selection and assign

456
00:14:16,720 --> 00:14:19,279
those as branches as well but now you

457
00:14:19,279 --> 00:14:20,720
can see that's kind of a cute little

458
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:21,680
chunky

459
00:14:21,680 --> 00:14:24,320
chunky little poly tree there

460
00:14:24,320 --> 00:14:27,519
that will work uh just fine for our

461
00:14:27,519 --> 00:14:28,480
scene here

462
00:14:28,480 --> 00:14:30,000
i want to scale it down along with y a

463
00:14:30,000 --> 00:14:31,600
little bit

464
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:33,279
that's rather cute though and you can go

465
00:14:33,279 --> 00:14:35,279
ahead and duplicate this tree as well

466
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,519
for another one back here maybe a little

467
00:14:37,519 --> 00:14:39,920
smaller

468
00:14:39,920 --> 00:14:42,160
cool now a few final details because

469
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,440
those always look really cool in these

470
00:14:43,440 --> 00:14:45,680
low poly scenes we'll just be adding in

471
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:47,839
a little ecosphere here and there that

472
00:14:47,839 --> 00:14:49,519
is a dark green bush i'm just going to

473
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,880
give this material of our dark green

474
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:52,399
here maybe hit that button to make it

475
00:14:52,399 --> 00:14:55,360
even darker green and scale it down for

476
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,360
a little chunky bush now if you tab in

477
00:14:57,360 --> 00:14:58,639
edit mode again with proportional

478
00:14:58,639 --> 00:15:00,480
editing enabled we can make this look a

479
00:15:00,480 --> 00:15:02,079
little bit different

480
00:15:02,079 --> 00:15:04,560
and then hit period to jump to that bush

481
00:15:04,560 --> 00:15:06,560
right there and i'll just duplicate it

482
00:15:06,560 --> 00:15:08,480
rotate it around scale it duplicate

483
00:15:08,480 --> 00:15:10,800
again just kind of adding in some of

484
00:15:10,800 --> 00:15:12,880
these cute little bushes

485
00:15:12,880 --> 00:15:15,120
around the scene

486
00:15:15,120 --> 00:15:17,199
i thought it added quite a bit

487
00:15:17,199 --> 00:15:18,160
to the

488
00:15:18,160 --> 00:15:19,360
to the character of the scene you know

489
00:15:19,360 --> 00:15:21,600
making it look a little bit more filled

490
00:15:21,600 --> 00:15:22,639
out

491
00:15:22,639 --> 00:15:25,120
and super easy to add these details in

492
00:15:25,120 --> 00:15:27,839
really fast

493
00:15:30,160 --> 00:15:31,920
something like that just adds a good

494
00:15:31,920 --> 00:15:33,440
amount to the scene

495
00:15:33,440 --> 00:15:34,800
and you can add some of these bushes as

496
00:15:34,800 --> 00:15:35,759
well

497
00:15:35,759 --> 00:15:40,160
over to your trees here

498
00:15:40,160 --> 00:15:41,920
a few little bushes around the base of

499
00:15:41,920 --> 00:15:44,240
these trees can kind of go a long way to

500
00:15:44,240 --> 00:15:47,279
add to the scene also a few cute little

501
00:15:47,279 --> 00:15:49,040
rocks maybe in the creek here looks nice

502
00:15:49,040 --> 00:15:50,160
so i'm going to go shift a add an

503
00:15:50,160 --> 00:15:52,240
icosphere take this one down to just a

504
00:15:52,240 --> 00:15:54,639
value of one scale it down tab to edit

505
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,199
mode give it a little bit of variation

506
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:59,680
scale it down a little bit more

507
00:15:59,680 --> 00:16:00,959
and then just duplicate this around a

508
00:16:00,959 --> 00:16:02,079
little bit

509
00:16:02,079 --> 00:16:05,199
just rotating it scaling it

510
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:06,800
that looks pretty good we'll duplicate

511
00:16:06,800 --> 00:16:08,639
both those pull them over here

512
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,079
grab them up along the zed because we're

513
00:16:10,079 --> 00:16:11,440
stuck in the middle of the mesh here

514
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:12,639
jump in the top you might make this

515
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,839
easier there we go

516
00:16:15,839 --> 00:16:18,000
scale them down just kind of stink them

517
00:16:18,000 --> 00:16:20,720
in the water there a little bit

518
00:16:20,720 --> 00:16:21,920
now i should mention that this scene is

519
00:16:21,920 --> 00:16:23,600
sort of based off some artwork by an

520
00:16:23,600 --> 00:16:25,120
artist that goes from the name of i

521
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:27,040
think it's pavel and he's got all kinds

522
00:16:27,040 --> 00:16:28,320
of different low poly worlds that he

523
00:16:28,320 --> 00:16:29,360
creates so if you guys need some

524
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:30,639
inspiration you can check out some of

525
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:31,519
his work if you want some more

526
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:32,880
inspiration it's always fun to see other

527
00:16:32,880 --> 00:16:34,320
people's takes on it too so if you

528
00:16:34,320 --> 00:16:35,839
create something cool post it on

529
00:16:35,839 --> 00:16:38,000
instagram and tag cg geeks so i can see

530
00:16:38,000 --> 00:16:39,839
what you created because i love seeing

531
00:16:39,839 --> 00:16:41,759
the awesome stuff that you guys come up

532
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,279
with so the last bit was a little

533
00:16:43,279 --> 00:16:45,279
campfire now on this side of the scene

534
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:46,800
just to kind of fill it out so what i

535
00:16:46,800 --> 00:16:49,199
started off doing is going shift a

536
00:16:49,199 --> 00:16:51,279
adding in a circle we'll take this down

537
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:54,000
to just like eight faces

538
00:16:54,000 --> 00:16:56,079
i'll tab in edit mode and i'll extrude

539
00:16:56,079 --> 00:16:58,240
it pull it up a little bit scale it down

540
00:16:58,240 --> 00:17:00,000
again we're using the randomizing here

541
00:17:00,000 --> 00:17:03,040
to give it some nice variation

542
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,959
then i'll extrude one more time and

543
00:17:04,959 --> 00:17:06,400
scale it in

544
00:17:06,400 --> 00:17:08,079
real nice and tight scale it all the way

545
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:10,000
down to zero

546
00:17:10,000 --> 00:17:11,439
okay now we can kind of pull some of

547
00:17:11,439 --> 00:17:13,119
these faces up and this is just sort of

548
00:17:13,119 --> 00:17:14,640
the platform in the ground where our

549
00:17:14,640 --> 00:17:17,119
campfire is going to be located for this

550
00:17:17,119 --> 00:17:19,919
we'll give it its own material sort of a

551
00:17:19,919 --> 00:17:22,880
sandy like material here looks kind of

552
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:24,160
good

553
00:17:24,160 --> 00:17:26,000
something along those lines then we just

554
00:17:26,000 --> 00:17:27,199
need some bricks for around the

555
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:28,799
fireplace now you may have noticed that

556
00:17:28,799 --> 00:17:31,120
i actually kind of incorporated the msi

557
00:17:31,120 --> 00:17:33,120
creator awards logo in this by doing the

558
00:17:33,120 --> 00:17:35,280
twisting bricks in a variation of color

559
00:17:35,280 --> 00:17:37,520
that fits the logo of the awards this

560
00:17:37,520 --> 00:17:38,960
year which was just kind of a way to

561
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:41,520
incorporate the logo in a sneaky way

562
00:17:41,520 --> 00:17:42,799
into my finished scene but for the

563
00:17:42,799 --> 00:17:44,240
tutorial i'll just show you the basic

564
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:45,840
process for the way i did this i'm gonna

565
00:17:45,840 --> 00:17:48,880
go shift a add in a plane scale it down

566
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,960
grab it along the zed so we can pull it

567
00:17:50,960 --> 00:17:53,440
out of the mesh there a little bit tab

568
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,440
in edit mode and i'm just going to make

569
00:17:55,440 --> 00:17:57,440
sort of a triangular shaped brick here a

570
00:17:57,440 --> 00:17:59,120
little bit of variation to it and

571
00:17:59,120 --> 00:18:02,240
extrude it up so we have a rock again

572
00:18:02,240 --> 00:18:03,760
using proportional editing now we can

573
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:06,160
give it a little bit of variation

574
00:18:06,160 --> 00:18:08,559
and give this its own material this will

575
00:18:08,559 --> 00:18:11,679
just be a slightly bluish grayish rock

576
00:18:11,679 --> 00:18:14,240
nothing too crazy

577
00:18:14,240 --> 00:18:16,160
and i will rotate it

578
00:18:16,160 --> 00:18:18,400
tap out edit mode i'll rotate it scale

579
00:18:18,400 --> 00:18:20,640
it down so we have sort of cool looking

580
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,160
rock and then just place it down at

581
00:18:22,160 --> 00:18:23,760
ground level there

582
00:18:23,760 --> 00:18:25,919
right around there looks good

583
00:18:25,919 --> 00:18:27,600
now for a fireplace what i can do is i

584
00:18:27,600 --> 00:18:28,880
can just place my cursor where i want

585
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:31,520
the fire to be and then hit period on my

586
00:18:31,520 --> 00:18:33,760
number pad and choose 3d cursor so now

587
00:18:33,760 --> 00:18:34,960
when i rotate it's going to rotate

588
00:18:34,960 --> 00:18:37,200
around the 3d cursor here so i can just

589
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:39,600
go shift d rotate

590
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:41,919
add a new brick there shift d rotate and

591
00:18:41,919 --> 00:18:44,080
actually if you hit shift r now it will

592
00:18:44,080 --> 00:18:45,600
just repeat that last step and rotate

593
00:18:45,600 --> 00:18:48,080
those blocks all the way around now that

594
00:18:48,080 --> 00:18:49,919
gives you a good layout to start working

595
00:18:49,919 --> 00:18:51,360
with i do recommend at this point that

596
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:52,720
you grab them all

597
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,799
unselect everything else hit ctrl j so

598
00:18:54,799 --> 00:18:56,880
they're all one object and then use

599
00:18:56,880 --> 00:18:59,120
proportional editing just to kind of add

600
00:18:59,120 --> 00:19:01,520
some variation to these rocks

601
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:03,360
you don't want something looking

602
00:19:03,360 --> 00:19:04,240
too

603
00:19:04,240 --> 00:19:06,880
similar because low poly is supposed to

604
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,480
be imperfect

605
00:19:08,480 --> 00:19:09,919
and that's what kind of gives it that

606
00:19:09,919 --> 00:19:12,559
charm and maybe make one variation of

607
00:19:12,559 --> 00:19:14,400
the rock color here for something a

608
00:19:14,400 --> 00:19:15,440
little bit different this can be a

609
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,640
little bit of a

610
00:19:16,640 --> 00:19:18,480
off-colored rock and you can grab some

611
00:19:18,480 --> 00:19:19,840
of this by just hovering over with your

612
00:19:19,840 --> 00:19:22,000
cursor and hitting l and assign this

613
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:25,120
color to those that looks kind of nice

614
00:19:25,120 --> 00:19:27,039
and from camera view you can see

615
00:19:27,039 --> 00:19:29,280
we have some blocks showing up doesn't

616
00:19:29,280 --> 00:19:30,640
look too bad

617
00:19:30,640 --> 00:19:31,840
we just need to kind of place these

618
00:19:31,840 --> 00:19:33,840
around so it does look a little better

619
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,840
from the camera view here now lastly we

620
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,360
can go ahead and add a little bit of a

621
00:19:37,360 --> 00:19:40,160
flame actually to this um

622
00:19:40,160 --> 00:19:42,480
fire fire pit here for this i'm going to

623
00:19:42,480 --> 00:19:45,120
go shift a add in a plane

624
00:19:45,120 --> 00:19:46,559
rotate it so it's kind of facing the

625
00:19:46,559 --> 00:19:48,720
camera there scale it down

626
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,080
then i'm going to tab into edit mode and

627
00:19:50,080 --> 00:19:52,160
give it a few loop cuts there and a few

628
00:19:52,160 --> 00:19:53,600
loop cuts there then i'm going to grab

629
00:19:53,600 --> 00:19:55,600
the vertices in the corner here turn off

630
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:57,679
proportional editing and just pull out

631
00:19:57,679 --> 00:19:59,760
random flame shape

632
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,440
kind of pull these vertices around

633
00:20:01,440 --> 00:20:03,360
giving ourselves sort of a random

634
00:20:03,360 --> 00:20:05,440
looking bit of fire

635
00:20:05,440 --> 00:20:06,880
it's really actually not that hard to

636
00:20:06,880 --> 00:20:08,640
just kind of

637
00:20:08,640 --> 00:20:10,400
pull these vertices around getting

638
00:20:10,400 --> 00:20:12,000
something that kind of looks like

639
00:20:12,000 --> 00:20:13,840
a cartoon

640
00:20:13,840 --> 00:20:16,000
cartoon amount of fire kind of popping

641
00:20:16,000 --> 00:20:17,520
out of the

642
00:20:17,520 --> 00:20:19,520
ground here that looks actually just

643
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:22,080
fine you scale it down

644
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,919
and pull some of these out even brighter

645
00:20:26,000 --> 00:20:27,440
and the material for this i'm just going

646
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:29,520
to hit new is actually going to be not a

647
00:20:29,520 --> 00:20:31,679
principle but an emission shader then

648
00:20:31,679 --> 00:20:32,880
you can go ahead and give this a nice

649
00:20:32,880 --> 00:20:34,559
orangey color

650
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:36,080
something like that

651
00:20:36,080 --> 00:20:37,200
crank the strength up a little bit

652
00:20:37,200 --> 00:20:38,480
higher

653
00:20:38,480 --> 00:20:41,200
and there you have your flame

654
00:20:41,200 --> 00:20:42,559
that looks pretty cute for last little

655
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,159
bit of color you can go down now to your

656
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,000
color management and give it a higher

657
00:20:46,000 --> 00:20:48,159
contrast look by giving it a medium high

658
00:20:48,159 --> 00:20:49,840
contrast there maybe increase the

659
00:20:49,840 --> 00:20:51,520
exposure just a little bit on the scene

660
00:20:51,520 --> 00:20:53,120
if you think it's a little dark take the

661
00:20:53,120 --> 00:20:54,799
brightness down a little bit on that

662
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:55,840
water

663
00:20:55,840 --> 00:20:57,200
maybe make it just a little bit of a

664
00:20:57,200 --> 00:20:59,760
deeper blue color water there and there

665
00:20:59,760 --> 00:21:02,400
is your low poly world created in

666
00:21:02,400 --> 00:21:03,440
blender i can't wait to see what you

667
00:21:03,440 --> 00:21:04,960
guys might create with this tutorial or

668
00:21:04,960 --> 00:21:07,039
it might be creating for the msi creator

669
00:21:07,039 --> 00:21:09,679
awards 2020 too but that's going to do

670
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:10,880
it for me guys thanks so much for

671
00:21:10,880 --> 00:21:12,400
watching if you have a question leave it

672
00:21:12,400 --> 00:21:13,919
as a comment in the comment section

673
00:21:13,919 --> 00:21:15,520
below if you like the video hit that

674
00:21:15,520 --> 00:21:17,200
thumbs up button have fun creating your

675
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:19,039
own low poly utopia and i'll see you

676
00:21:19,039 --> 00:21:22,960
guys in the next one peace
