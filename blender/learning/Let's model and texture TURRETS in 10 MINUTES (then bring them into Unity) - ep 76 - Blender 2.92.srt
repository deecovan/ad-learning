00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,879
hello guys and welcome to episode 76 of

2
00:00:02,879 --> 00:00:04,400
the 10 minute modeling challenge

3
00:00:04,400 --> 00:00:06,640
so last week we did a godzilla monster

4
00:00:06,640 --> 00:00:08,639
animation literally where we smashed up

5
00:00:08,639 --> 00:00:10,160
some pounds and we spent a lot of time

6
00:00:10,160 --> 00:00:11,920
keyframing that in the bonus material

7
00:00:11,920 --> 00:00:13,360
and this week i'm going to do something

8
00:00:13,360 --> 00:00:14,559
a little bit different

9
00:00:14,559 --> 00:00:16,400
we're going to do some low-poly turrets

10
00:00:16,400 --> 00:00:17,680
and i've prepared a few things you'll

11
00:00:17,680 --> 00:00:18,880
see that there's a little bit different

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:19,439
today

13
00:00:19,439 --> 00:00:21,760
because instead of using my normal uh

14
00:00:21,760 --> 00:00:23,359
colorizing texture i went to a

15
00:00:23,359 --> 00:00:25,519
royalty-free image site i just googled

16
00:00:25,519 --> 00:00:27,119
royalty-free images and i found

17
00:00:27,119 --> 00:00:29,279
pixabay.com so i decided to go there and

18
00:00:29,279 --> 00:00:31,039
search for supercars because

19
00:00:31,039 --> 00:00:32,880
supercars tend to have some interesting

20
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,640
colors and shapes to them

21
00:00:34,640 --> 00:00:36,480
and i downloaded a few random images

22
00:00:36,480 --> 00:00:38,320
from there and then i cropped them out

23
00:00:38,320 --> 00:00:39,840
game engines like to have square

24
00:00:39,840 --> 00:00:41,760
textures that are the power of two

25
00:00:41,760 --> 00:00:44,239
in size so i got uh some textures that i

26
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:45,840
cropped down to 5 12 by 5

27
00:00:45,840 --> 00:00:48,160
12 pixels and i've imported one of those

28
00:00:48,160 --> 00:00:50,079
and i'm actually going to use the base

29
00:00:50,079 --> 00:00:50,800
color now

30
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,399
or just like a random sample in the

31
00:00:52,399 --> 00:00:54,079
image for the modeling part but then

32
00:00:54,079 --> 00:00:55,520
we'll randomize the textures

33
00:00:55,520 --> 00:00:57,120
if you're making a game that you're

34
00:00:57,120 --> 00:00:58,640
going to play on a mobile phone

35
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,320
or if the items are going to be quite

36
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:02,160
small the turrets in this case

37
00:01:02,160 --> 00:01:04,159
then you get away with this randomized

38
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:05,519
look but if you want to have a close-up

39
00:01:05,519 --> 00:01:07,040
you should really draw your textures and

40
00:01:07,040 --> 00:01:08,240
have them fitted and

41
00:01:08,240 --> 00:01:09,760
uv mapped of course but i won't have

42
00:01:09,760 --> 00:01:11,280
time to do that in the 10-minute

43
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,560
video so i thought this could be an

44
00:01:12,560 --> 00:01:14,000
interesting twist to it i've also

45
00:01:14,000 --> 00:01:15,759
prepared a little unity project

46
00:01:15,759 --> 00:01:17,600
where i've got some turrets auto firing

47
00:01:17,600 --> 00:01:19,439
on targets that are closest to them and

48
00:01:19,439 --> 00:01:21,200
i'll hopefully make a tutorial out of

49
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:21,920
that one too

50
00:01:21,920 --> 00:01:23,439
but if you're a patreon of mine you can

51
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:25,920
actually go to patreon.com

52
00:01:25,920 --> 00:01:28,640
and the game dev tier or the tutorial

53
00:01:28,640 --> 00:01:29,840
tearing up in fact

54
00:01:29,840 --> 00:01:31,759
we'll be able to download this unity

55
00:01:31,759 --> 00:01:33,200
project that i've prepared so you can

56
00:01:33,200 --> 00:01:34,560
have a play around with it maybe use it

57
00:01:34,560 --> 00:01:35,439
as a base for

58
00:01:35,439 --> 00:01:37,520
your own game so let's set the timer i

59
00:01:37,520 --> 00:01:39,439
was cut this part out but maybe i'll put

60
00:01:39,439 --> 00:01:40,240
it in one day

61
00:01:40,240 --> 00:01:42,880
all right let's get going ready steady

62
00:01:42,880 --> 00:01:43,280
go

63
00:01:43,280 --> 00:01:44,880
let's model some low poly turrets tab

64
00:01:44,880 --> 00:01:46,880
into edit mode hold the ctrl key

65
00:01:46,880 --> 00:01:48,960
snap this one up there this is going to

66
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:50,880
be the base just so scale to scale that

67
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:51,840
one down

68
00:01:51,840 --> 00:01:54,399
e to extrude s to scale heat extrude

69
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:56,399
just to scale that one down as well

70
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,159
that's going to be the base shift d

71
00:01:58,159 --> 00:01:59,920
duplicate that one here's the

72
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:04,240
turret part so e to extrude that on

73
00:02:04,240 --> 00:02:06,000
keep it super low poly of course e to

74
00:02:06,000 --> 00:02:08,239
extrude that's the scale

75
00:02:08,239 --> 00:02:11,360
um and ctrl r maybe we'll do slightly

76
00:02:11,360 --> 00:02:12,239
different

77
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:15,680
thickness there shift d duplicate that

78
00:02:15,680 --> 00:02:16,160
one

79
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:19,520
scale y scale z zero so we flatten that

80
00:02:19,520 --> 00:02:19,920
one

81
00:02:19,920 --> 00:02:22,879
e to extrude that one and actually i'm

82
00:02:22,879 --> 00:02:23,200
going to

83
00:02:23,200 --> 00:02:24,879
scale x to zero and make that square

84
00:02:24,879 --> 00:02:26,959
again oh we have to do uh of course

85
00:02:26,959 --> 00:02:29,760
auto mirror so that's the add-on yeah

86
00:02:29,760 --> 00:02:30,800
it's included

87
00:02:30,800 --> 00:02:34,000
just enable it and here

88
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:36,400
let's do some arms shift b duplicate e

89
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:37,840
to extrude

90
00:02:37,840 --> 00:02:40,400
and he'll put the torrents now shift d

91
00:02:40,400 --> 00:02:41,120
scale

92
00:02:41,120 --> 00:02:44,319
e to extruder on e to extrude s to scale

93
00:02:44,319 --> 00:02:47,680
z only the z axis and then here we'll do

94
00:02:47,680 --> 00:02:48,720
the actual

95
00:02:48,720 --> 00:02:51,360
barrel part so shift d duplicate test

96
00:02:51,360 --> 00:02:52,800
scale e to extrude

97
00:02:52,800 --> 00:02:54,239
shift d i'm going to make this a

98
00:02:54,239 --> 00:02:56,239
separate object so we can animate these

99
00:02:56,239 --> 00:02:58,800
height inset and then just do a little

100
00:02:58,800 --> 00:03:00,319
hole here

101
00:03:00,319 --> 00:03:02,720
that's it and should we put some more

102
00:03:02,720 --> 00:03:04,239
interesting features here probably e to

103
00:03:04,239 --> 00:03:05,200
extrude oh

104
00:03:05,200 --> 00:03:07,599
that's wrong need to extrude move that

105
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,959
one down

106
00:03:08,959 --> 00:03:12,319
just break it up a little bit more

107
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:14,800
need to extrude that's the scale bring

108
00:03:14,800 --> 00:03:16,319
it in

109
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:19,120
here as well should we do maybe i'll do

110
00:03:19,120 --> 00:03:19,920
uh

111
00:03:19,920 --> 00:03:21,680
shift d duplicate i'm just doing some

112
00:03:21,680 --> 00:03:23,440
random stuff of course normal

113
00:03:23,440 --> 00:03:26,959
infensio style alt e texture long face

114
00:03:26,959 --> 00:03:28,480
normals

115
00:03:28,480 --> 00:03:32,560
control r bring that up

116
00:03:32,560 --> 00:03:36,159
and maybe shift the duplicates eat

117
00:03:36,159 --> 00:03:37,360
extrude

118
00:03:37,360 --> 00:03:39,120
and let's put some interesting legs on

119
00:03:39,120 --> 00:03:40,480
it two minutes gone

120
00:03:40,480 --> 00:03:46,239
so scale why

121
00:03:46,239 --> 00:03:48,560
just going to bring those in eat extrude

122
00:03:48,560 --> 00:03:49,440
but we'll

123
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:53,439
bring it to there and then

124
00:03:53,439 --> 00:03:59,280
we'll do maybe ctrl r heat extrude

125
00:03:59,439 --> 00:04:02,480
should we do like clampy feet to eat

126
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:03,519
extrude

127
00:04:03,519 --> 00:04:06,159
that should be good

128
00:04:08,400 --> 00:04:10,640
and bring that in should we move it in a

129
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:11,439
little bit further

130
00:04:11,439 --> 00:04:15,840
that's it ctrl r

131
00:04:17,839 --> 00:04:21,519
scale i don't like the that vertex is

132
00:04:21,519 --> 00:04:24,160
over there so let's move that on in

133
00:04:24,160 --> 00:04:27,840
that's it and

134
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:31,919
l to select this one shift the scale

135
00:04:31,919 --> 00:04:34,400
y minus one that flips it but we need to

136
00:04:34,400 --> 00:04:35,120
do alt n

137
00:04:35,120 --> 00:04:37,759
and recalculate outside to flip the

138
00:04:37,759 --> 00:04:39,360
normals there that's why it's good to

139
00:04:39,360 --> 00:04:42,160
have backface calling on

140
00:04:42,160 --> 00:04:43,759
and one more feature here maybe on the

141
00:04:43,759 --> 00:04:45,680
side shift b

142
00:04:45,680 --> 00:04:49,040
scale e to extrude

143
00:04:49,199 --> 00:04:52,160
that's it and each extrude that's the

144
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:52,639
scale

145
00:04:52,639 --> 00:04:54,000
that's it that's going to be our first

146
00:04:54,000 --> 00:04:56,479
turret maybe we'll do one more

147
00:04:56,479 --> 00:04:59,680
or two more possibly

148
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,360
maybe we could texture map it in the 10

149
00:05:01,360 --> 00:05:03,440
minutes as well so that's turret number

150
00:05:03,440 --> 00:05:04,479
one

151
00:05:04,479 --> 00:05:08,720
let's do shift d to duplicate it

152
00:05:08,720 --> 00:05:11,759
actually i'll probably texture the base

153
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,800
should i

154
00:05:12,800 --> 00:05:15,840
so we get the same look nah shift d to

155
00:05:15,840 --> 00:05:16,639
duplicate the

156
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:19,840
shift space g hold the ctrl key to snap

157
00:05:19,840 --> 00:05:21,919
it into here

158
00:05:21,919 --> 00:05:23,039
and then we'll do this one a little bit

159
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:25,199
different so i'll select l just select

160
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:26,080
all the linked

161
00:05:26,080 --> 00:05:27,440
ones because i'm still in the same

162
00:05:27,440 --> 00:05:30,639
object delete all of those

163
00:05:30,639 --> 00:05:32,560
let's make a different type of tart here

164
00:05:32,560 --> 00:05:34,000
so we can change the base a little bit

165
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,160
too

166
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,440
maybe a little bit longer there and this

167
00:05:39,440 --> 00:05:40,720
one can come

168
00:05:40,720 --> 00:05:43,520
in all of it

169
00:05:43,759 --> 00:05:47,520
ctrl r move that up

170
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:53,280
bring this in

171
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,759
gg slides it along an edge so that's

172
00:05:55,759 --> 00:05:57,520
pretty handy

173
00:05:57,520 --> 00:06:00,080
like good game and then the bass can

174
00:06:00,080 --> 00:06:01,360
look pretty much the same shifty

175
00:06:01,360 --> 00:06:03,280
duplicate

176
00:06:03,280 --> 00:06:04,560
and we should have a different look on

177
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:08,479
this one each extrude

178
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:12,080
and ctrl r loop cut scale

179
00:06:12,080 --> 00:06:14,400
ctrl r make it look different i say and

180
00:06:14,400 --> 00:06:17,440
then i do it looking the same

181
00:06:17,680 --> 00:06:19,919
yeah okay maybe i'll do all the texture

182
00:06:19,919 --> 00:06:22,400
along the place normals there

183
00:06:22,400 --> 00:06:24,479
and should we have it coming up from the

184
00:06:24,479 --> 00:06:26,080
back here maybe

185
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:29,280
so we'll do uh here shifty

186
00:06:29,280 --> 00:06:32,880
scale bring it in e to extrude

187
00:06:32,880 --> 00:06:36,080
heat to extrude control r i have no idea

188
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:37,919
what i'm doing now e to extrude

189
00:06:37,919 --> 00:06:41,759
with some randomness always good

190
00:06:41,759 --> 00:06:43,199
unless you're making a game apparently

191
00:06:43,199 --> 00:06:44,639
you shouldn't use random elements in the

192
00:06:44,639 --> 00:06:46,240
game i annoys people

193
00:06:46,240 --> 00:06:48,639
e to extrude should we do them hanging

194
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,080
down maybe from this one

195
00:06:50,080 --> 00:06:52,479
so i'll do like an arm here shift the

196
00:06:52,479 --> 00:06:54,880
scale

197
00:06:56,240 --> 00:06:59,599
and e to extrude maybe we'll do each

198
00:06:59,599 --> 00:07:00,720
extrude there as well that was a bit

199
00:07:00,720 --> 00:07:03,840
unnecessary but it's okay

200
00:07:04,960 --> 00:07:07,919
and e to extrude that on here we'll do

201
00:07:07,919 --> 00:07:10,240
them hanging down e to extrude

202
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:13,919
s to scale maybe on the x axis

203
00:07:15,039 --> 00:07:19,840
and shift the scale e to extrude

204
00:07:19,840 --> 00:07:22,080
normal style and actually got allergies

205
00:07:22,080 --> 00:07:23,120
now so

206
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,960
i've got something to blame for a change

207
00:07:24,960 --> 00:07:27,120
shift the scale

208
00:07:27,120 --> 00:07:30,800
for my little heartling it's extrude

209
00:07:30,800 --> 00:07:32,720
and should we do just a different design

210
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:35,039
on this one all together

211
00:07:35,039 --> 00:07:38,639
ctrl r again alt select around there

212
00:07:38,639 --> 00:07:41,919
scale zed

213
00:07:42,560 --> 00:07:45,599
maybe like this i need to extrude s to

214
00:07:45,599 --> 00:07:46,879
scale and we'll do the

215
00:07:46,879 --> 00:07:50,639
item set and e to extrude in

216
00:07:50,639 --> 00:07:52,160
and some slightly different features

217
00:07:52,160 --> 00:07:54,639
maybe two just the box here looks a bit

218
00:07:54,639 --> 00:07:56,080
plain doesn't it

219
00:07:56,080 --> 00:08:00,960
so we'll do uh shift d to duplicate

220
00:08:00,960 --> 00:08:04,319
alt e to extrude long face normals

221
00:08:04,319 --> 00:08:08,080
l to select the link scale x

222
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:12,639
and bring these in control r

223
00:08:12,639 --> 00:08:16,639
ctrl r let's look at a few of these

224
00:08:16,639 --> 00:08:20,479
all the extra long phase normals

225
00:08:20,800 --> 00:08:24,960
and that should be all right i think

226
00:08:24,960 --> 00:08:26,800
able to shift the i've got three minutes

227
00:08:26,800 --> 00:08:28,560
so we should try to just do the random

228
00:08:28,560 --> 00:08:30,879
texturizing here clipping off

229
00:08:30,879 --> 00:08:33,039
clipping on again we'll just do two

230
00:08:33,039 --> 00:08:35,599
turrets i think

231
00:08:35,599 --> 00:08:37,599
two different looks on them and we can

232
00:08:37,599 --> 00:08:39,279
put some different design here on this

233
00:08:39,279 --> 00:08:40,799
barrel e to extrude

234
00:08:40,799 --> 00:08:44,000
some fancy shifty

235
00:08:44,000 --> 00:08:47,680
extrude i don't know if it's that fancy

236
00:08:47,680 --> 00:08:51,440
to be honest shifty duplicate

237
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:54,800
each extrude and should

238
00:08:54,800 --> 00:08:58,480
put one more thing here shift the

239
00:08:58,480 --> 00:09:00,880
scale all the extra long phase normals

240
00:09:00,880 --> 00:09:03,200
that's it

241
00:09:03,200 --> 00:09:06,160
and e to extrude that one okay so we've

242
00:09:06,160 --> 00:09:09,680
got two turrets here now different sizes

243
00:09:09,680 --> 00:09:11,680
we've got an itchy nose too take care

244
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,200
took care of that pretty fast

245
00:09:13,200 --> 00:09:14,640
two minutes thirty okay let's texture

246
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:17,279
map these so i'm just gonna go to

247
00:09:17,279 --> 00:09:19,760
tab into edit mode select all of them

248
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:21,360
and then we're going to uh not shading

249
00:09:21,360 --> 00:09:23,200
uv editing that's where i was actually

250
00:09:23,200 --> 00:09:26,800
uv and then just smart uv project okay

251
00:09:26,800 --> 00:09:29,440
and that'll just throw the texture

252
00:09:29,440 --> 00:09:30,959
randomly onto this one

253
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:32,480
and then you can play around with the

254
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:34,720
panning of it so if i scale it

255
00:09:34,720 --> 00:09:36,959
it'll just change it and usually i

256
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:37,760
prefer to go

257
00:09:37,760 --> 00:09:39,519
smaller actually like this because

258
00:09:39,519 --> 00:09:40,959
you're going to watch look at them from

259
00:09:40,959 --> 00:09:42,080
a distance like this

260
00:09:42,080 --> 00:09:44,880
probably but you can play around with it

261
00:09:44,880 --> 00:09:46,480
you can also move it outside it doesn't

262
00:09:46,480 --> 00:09:48,160
matter because it seamlessly wraps

263
00:09:48,160 --> 00:09:50,240
around the corners there so you can even

264
00:09:50,240 --> 00:09:52,160
find any place here and you can also

265
00:09:52,160 --> 00:09:53,760
rotate it if you want to rotate for a

266
00:09:53,760 --> 00:09:54,800
different look

267
00:09:54,800 --> 00:09:56,320
so if you find like an interesting part

268
00:09:56,320 --> 00:09:58,720
here maybe where it contrasts between

269
00:09:58,720 --> 00:10:00,640
white and black and then rotate it

270
00:10:00,640 --> 00:10:03,200
and you can find a decent looking like

271
00:10:03,200 --> 00:10:04,320
turret like this

272
00:10:04,320 --> 00:10:05,920
and if we wanted to have the barrels

273
00:10:05,920 --> 00:10:08,160
maybe in one color

274
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:10,320
there's we can select l for or we'll

275
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:12,560
just do l here for the length

276
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:14,480
scale zero works on this one but

277
00:10:14,480 --> 00:10:15,920
remember in unreal engine it's a bit

278
00:10:15,920 --> 00:10:16,560
picky

279
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:18,399
so you might have to do a little bit

280
00:10:18,399 --> 00:10:19,920
different there you can't go infinitely

281
00:10:19,920 --> 00:10:21,200
smaller i think

282
00:10:21,200 --> 00:10:23,519
but let's put it like that so we have a

283
00:10:23,519 --> 00:10:24,560
solid color on there

284
00:10:24,560 --> 00:10:26,640
and maybe here as well we'll do so solid

285
00:10:26,640 --> 00:10:28,720
colors on these

286
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,880
you can keep the random look but usually

287
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,240
maybe for the barrels you want to keep

288
00:10:32,240 --> 00:10:33,360
it slightly different

289
00:10:33,360 --> 00:10:35,519
for this one as well we'll do tab 8

290
00:10:35,519 --> 00:10:37,839
select everything

291
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:40,880
uv smart uv project okay

292
00:10:40,880 --> 00:10:44,160
and then scale rotate just fine

293
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:45,600
usually symmetry makes it looks pretty

294
00:10:45,600 --> 00:10:47,360
cool like this in different

295
00:10:47,360 --> 00:10:49,760
angles and stuff we'll do l to select

296
00:10:49,760 --> 00:10:51,200
the length here

297
00:10:51,200 --> 00:10:53,839
and go scale zero on the left so we get

298
00:10:53,839 --> 00:10:55,760
a solid colored barrel here it looks

299
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:56,880
probably a little bit better when we

300
00:10:56,880 --> 00:10:58,800
animate

301
00:10:58,800 --> 00:11:00,320
and if you wanted to change you could

302
00:11:00,320 --> 00:11:01,680
just change the base here as well maybe

303
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:03,519
these are too big maybe we wanted them a

304
00:11:03,519 --> 00:11:04,160
little bit more

305
00:11:04,160 --> 00:11:07,680
solid colored i can make them smaller

306
00:11:07,680 --> 00:11:11,839
rotate just random random stuff

307
00:11:12,160 --> 00:11:15,279
so that's it we've got uh maybe we can

308
00:11:15,279 --> 00:11:15,760
test

309
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,079
we've got 27 seconds to spare we can

310
00:11:18,079 --> 00:11:19,040
actually try to

311
00:11:19,040 --> 00:11:22,160
change the texture here as well so

312
00:11:22,160 --> 00:11:25,360
let's just open and do the

313
00:11:25,360 --> 00:11:29,279
blue one instead editing

314
00:11:29,279 --> 00:11:32,000
okay that looked hideous so it's a

315
00:11:32,000 --> 00:11:33,519
little bit dependent on which textures

316
00:11:33,519 --> 00:11:36,560
they use apparently so

317
00:11:36,560 --> 00:11:39,440
go tab inside mode 8 to select

318
00:11:39,440 --> 00:11:41,200
everything and then you can move that to

319
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,320
a different color change it move it and

320
00:11:44,320 --> 00:11:46,720
that's it

321
00:11:48,000 --> 00:11:50,240
that's it 10 minutes is up and we've got

322
00:11:50,240 --> 00:11:51,200
some random looking

323
00:11:51,200 --> 00:11:53,519
uh stuff i'll go back just control that

324
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,240
a few times

325
00:11:54,240 --> 00:11:55,680
so we get that other texture back i

326
00:11:55,680 --> 00:11:57,839
think

327
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,120
i think it looks a little bit better

328
00:11:59,120 --> 00:12:01,360
with the gray there but we can test it

329
00:12:01,360 --> 00:12:02,880
around in the unity as well i'll show

330
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:03,200
you

331
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:04,720
a few tips there so what we'll do is

332
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:06,399
export these into uh two

333
00:12:06,399 --> 00:12:08,079
like turrets that we'll import into

334
00:12:08,079 --> 00:12:09,920
unity in the bonus material note so this

335
00:12:09,920 --> 00:12:11,360
is not going to be a tutorial because

336
00:12:11,360 --> 00:12:13,279
i'm going to run through it pretty fast

337
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,760
but i've got everything prepared so uh

338
00:12:15,760 --> 00:12:17,519
put in the comments i always ask that if

339
00:12:17,519 --> 00:12:19,040
you want a tutorial and people say yes

340
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:21,040
and then i don't have time to make them

341
00:12:21,040 --> 00:12:23,440
or i find something else to do stupid i

342
00:12:23,440 --> 00:12:24,639
know but

343
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:27,279
i'll try anyway so let's export these

344
00:12:27,279 --> 00:12:28,560
i'm gonna export them as

345
00:12:28,560 --> 00:12:30,399
three different objects so if i do l

346
00:12:30,399 --> 00:12:32,240
here on the base

347
00:12:32,240 --> 00:12:34,160
i will select the base stuff there press

348
00:12:34,160 --> 00:12:36,399
p and separate the selection

349
00:12:36,399 --> 00:12:39,040
and i'm gonna press f2 rename this one

350
00:12:39,040 --> 00:12:39,680
turret

351
00:12:39,680 --> 00:12:44,079
one base let's call it imagination there

352
00:12:44,079 --> 00:12:45,680
and then here the barrels i'm gonna do

353
00:12:45,680 --> 00:12:46,800
separate as well because we wanna

354
00:12:46,800 --> 00:12:48,560
animate the barrels here so when they

355
00:12:48,560 --> 00:12:49,839
fire

356
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:51,279
they're gonna shoot back a little bit

357
00:12:51,279 --> 00:12:53,680
like a recoil effect like this

358
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:56,240
looks pretty cool so i'm gonna do this

359
00:12:56,240 --> 00:12:57,279
one and then do

360
00:12:57,279 --> 00:12:59,839
p to separate by selection and then

361
00:12:59,839 --> 00:13:02,079
we'll do f2 and rename this one

362
00:13:02,079 --> 00:13:04,880
turret one

363
00:13:05,519 --> 00:13:06,800
is barrel how you spell barrel i think

364
00:13:06,800 --> 00:13:09,120
so and then we'll do the top here that's

365
00:13:09,120 --> 00:13:10,480
already separated so

366
00:13:10,480 --> 00:13:15,040
f2 and we'll call this one top

367
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:16,959
and it's important that the center of

368
00:13:16,959 --> 00:13:18,320
rotation for this now

369
00:13:18,320 --> 00:13:20,399
is where you want it to be and we're

370
00:13:20,399 --> 00:13:22,320
going to parent the the barrels here to

371
00:13:22,320 --> 00:13:22,639
this

372
00:13:22,639 --> 00:13:24,079
top here so don't worry about that the

373
00:13:24,079 --> 00:13:26,800
barrels will rotate with the object

374
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,120
you might just petrify that i wasn't

375
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:30,880
recording again

376
00:13:30,880 --> 00:13:33,440
so that's the first one and we can hide

377
00:13:33,440 --> 00:13:35,200
this one for now

378
00:13:35,200 --> 00:13:38,560
i'm missing something here okay then i

379
00:13:38,560 --> 00:13:40,720
rename this

380
00:13:40,720 --> 00:13:44,240
barrel there we go so let's hide those

381
00:13:44,240 --> 00:13:46,880
i'll select this one and do alt g that

382
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,480
moves it back to orego or

383
00:13:48,480 --> 00:13:51,680
the default center location here

384
00:13:51,680 --> 00:13:54,639
so and then we'll do the same here we'll

385
00:13:54,639 --> 00:13:55,040
do

386
00:13:55,040 --> 00:13:57,199
f tab inside mode l to select the base

387
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:58,560
stuff here and then

388
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:01,600
p separate selection that's it

389
00:14:01,600 --> 00:14:02,959
and then i'll do all of them first

390
00:14:02,959 --> 00:14:04,560
actually we'll do the barrels here these

391
00:14:04,560 --> 00:14:06,399
are the ones that are going to recoil

392
00:14:06,399 --> 00:14:09,040
so p separate by selection and then

393
00:14:09,040 --> 00:14:09,519
we'll do

394
00:14:09,519 --> 00:14:14,079
f2 turret to barrel

395
00:14:14,079 --> 00:14:16,320
and then we'll rename this one f2 turret

396
00:14:16,320 --> 00:14:17,600
to

397
00:14:17,600 --> 00:14:21,440
top and here f2 turret

398
00:14:21,440 --> 00:14:25,120
to base so these are all prepped now

399
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
let's grab them all put them in the same

400
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,720
scene like this

401
00:14:28,720 --> 00:14:30,480
select them all of them all of them

402
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:32,240
selected you can right click here as

403
00:14:32,240 --> 00:14:32,560
well

404
00:14:32,560 --> 00:14:36,160
and do select objects or you can just

405
00:14:36,160 --> 00:14:39,120
drag and drop and then we'll go file

406
00:14:39,120 --> 00:14:40,560
export

407
00:14:40,560 --> 00:14:42,839
fpx and then here we'll do selected

408
00:14:42,839 --> 00:14:44,160
objects

409
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:46,320
apply scalings we'll do unit scale fbx

410
00:14:46,320 --> 00:14:48,000
unit scale and then apply time

411
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:49,519
transform it's a little shortcut to get

412
00:14:49,519 --> 00:14:50,800
the rotation correct but it doesn't work

413
00:14:50,800 --> 00:14:52,800
for armatures remember

414
00:14:52,800 --> 00:14:56,320
and we'll rename this one to turrets

415
00:14:56,320 --> 00:15:00,320
um 10 mmc 76 turrets

416
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:02,560
export all right so let's jump into the

417
00:15:02,560 --> 00:15:04,240
unity project that i've prepared now and

418
00:15:04,240 --> 00:15:05,760
i won't be able to go through it but

419
00:15:05,760 --> 00:15:08,079
what i do have is i've created a base

420
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,040
turret

421
00:15:09,040 --> 00:15:11,519
game object hierarchy with a base a

422
00:15:11,519 --> 00:15:12,240
turret

423
00:15:12,240 --> 00:15:14,480
a barrel and some muzzle location so i

424
00:15:14,480 --> 00:15:15,680
know where the bullets are going to be

425
00:15:15,680 --> 00:15:16,720
fired from

426
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:18,880
and some audio when it rotates and then

427
00:15:18,880 --> 00:15:20,480
i've created some prefabs as well

428
00:15:20,480 --> 00:15:24,079
a bullet an explosion and a target just

429
00:15:24,079 --> 00:15:26,240
a test target and some impact effects

430
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:29,519
and turret so what we'll do is

431
00:15:29,519 --> 00:15:31,440
i'm going to go into this one and we'll

432
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,680
just drag and drop this

433
00:15:33,680 --> 00:15:36,560
fbx file that i've created into this

434
00:15:36,560 --> 00:15:37,199
folder

435
00:15:37,199 --> 00:15:40,000
meshes so we've got these meshes here

436
00:15:40,000 --> 00:15:43,040
you recognize them here

437
00:15:43,199 --> 00:15:44,720
and we also have to grab those textures

438
00:15:44,720 --> 00:15:46,320
that we got so i'm going to drag and

439
00:15:46,320 --> 00:15:48,079
drop those into

440
00:15:48,079 --> 00:15:52,839
let's just do here create folder

441
00:15:52,839 --> 00:15:55,759
textures and we'll drag and drop those

442
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:57,199
ones that i created before i'll

443
00:15:57,199 --> 00:15:58,639
grab the square ones so it's the same

444
00:15:58,639 --> 00:16:01,360
ones so we'll drag this one in

445
00:16:01,360 --> 00:16:02,959
which we haven't tested the orange one

446
00:16:02,959 --> 00:16:05,279
here which we haven't tested either

447
00:16:05,279 --> 00:16:07,920
and we've got the white one and the

448
00:16:07,920 --> 00:16:11,199
other square one here which one

449
00:16:11,440 --> 00:16:15,920
oh yeah the blue one there we go

450
00:16:15,920 --> 00:16:18,639
and i have to set these meshes now as

451
00:16:18,639 --> 00:16:19,040
well

452
00:16:19,040 --> 00:16:23,519
so we've got turret what turret one base

453
00:16:23,519 --> 00:16:26,720
and we've got turret one

454
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:29,839
top here which is called turret here

455
00:16:29,839 --> 00:16:32,959
and we've got the barrels

456
00:16:33,440 --> 00:16:35,759
turret one barrel and you have to grab

457
00:16:35,759 --> 00:16:37,120
the mesh object down here

458
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:41,279
so it knows that's it

459
00:16:41,759 --> 00:16:43,920
so if i grab that one we'll drag this

460
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,519
texture that we imported

461
00:16:45,519 --> 00:16:48,800
we'll use the same one turret and we'll

462
00:16:48,800 --> 00:16:49,440
grab

463
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:51,279
this gray texture and drag it into the

464
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,800
base map here

465
00:16:52,800 --> 00:16:56,880
and you should recognize it there

466
00:16:58,160 --> 00:17:05,199
let's move this one into the center so

467
00:17:05,199 --> 00:17:06,480
and then i should move it up a little

468
00:17:06,480 --> 00:17:09,039
bit probably

469
00:17:12,160 --> 00:17:14,559
that's it so i've got the turret here

470
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:16,000
and like i said i won't have time to go

471
00:17:16,000 --> 00:17:17,760
through how i've created everything

472
00:17:17,760 --> 00:17:20,559
but just a short run through is on the

473
00:17:20,559 --> 00:17:22,160
base here on the turret i've got like a

474
00:17:22,160 --> 00:17:23,439
turret script where i can set

475
00:17:23,439 --> 00:17:26,079
targeting speed a search radius how long

476
00:17:26,079 --> 00:17:27,760
it should be searching for targets

477
00:17:27,760 --> 00:17:29,360
and how many rounds per minute it should

478
00:17:29,360 --> 00:17:31,280
be firing and then i've set which prefab

479
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:32,559
it should be

480
00:17:32,559 --> 00:17:34,480
that it fires and that's just a bullet

481
00:17:34,480 --> 00:17:35,760
with a trail on it

482
00:17:35,760 --> 00:17:37,440
and then i've got muzzles here and these

483
00:17:37,440 --> 00:17:39,679
we need to configure so

484
00:17:39,679 --> 00:17:44,240
where you got select the muzzle l here

485
00:17:44,240 --> 00:17:46,080
and then i usually click here on

486
00:17:46,080 --> 00:17:48,080
perspective and go into iso

487
00:17:48,080 --> 00:17:50,240
isometric click on the z axis because

488
00:17:50,240 --> 00:17:51,440
then it's going to be easier to

489
00:17:51,440 --> 00:17:53,039
position this one in the center of the

490
00:17:53,039 --> 00:17:54,640
barrel there

491
00:17:54,640 --> 00:17:56,080
then we have to do the same for the top

492
00:17:56,080 --> 00:17:57,679
so i press on this y axis

493
00:17:57,679 --> 00:18:00,559
and then we move this one down to there

494
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:02,640
and then to save time you could uh

495
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:05,360
i could just delete this right one okay

496
00:18:05,360 --> 00:18:07,120
i can't because it's a prefab okay let's

497
00:18:07,120 --> 00:18:09,840
do it this way now

498
00:18:10,480 --> 00:18:15,360
i'll go to the muzzle l here

499
00:18:15,360 --> 00:18:18,320
copy position and then right click here

500
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,679
oh no i don't right click

501
00:18:19,679 --> 00:18:22,400
paste position and then we just flip the

502
00:18:22,400 --> 00:18:24,400
x value for this one

503
00:18:24,400 --> 00:18:26,160
and now that those two muzzles are in

504
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:27,760
the right place here for

505
00:18:27,760 --> 00:18:29,200
so he knows where to fire the bullet

506
00:18:29,200 --> 00:18:31,039
from so these are little helper

507
00:18:31,039 --> 00:18:34,559
transforms and we can try this out now

508
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:37,280
so if i press play we should always have

509
00:18:37,280 --> 00:18:39,600
ourselves a little targeting turret here

510
00:18:39,600 --> 00:18:42,080
that we just designed and it aims and

511
00:18:42,080 --> 00:18:43,039
fires at

512
00:18:43,039 --> 00:18:44,720
just a target that spawns at the mouse

513
00:18:44,720 --> 00:18:46,880
cursor

514
00:18:46,880 --> 00:18:48,799
and if you click i just made it so and

515
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:51,520
it keeps targeting the closest one there

516
00:18:51,520 --> 00:18:53,360
and i'll put some random sound effects

517
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:55,120
on there from my blasters sound effects

518
00:18:55,120 --> 00:18:56,720
library and in fact if you go to

519
00:18:56,720 --> 00:18:58,320
infantia.com and look up

520
00:18:58,320 --> 00:19:00,480
blaster's sound effects library if you

521
00:19:00,480 --> 00:19:01,520
use the code

522
00:19:01,520 --> 00:19:04,960
10mmc ep76

523
00:19:04,960 --> 00:19:06,880
then you'll get 50 discount and you can

524
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:08,640
download thousands of blaster sound

525
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:10,240
effects pretty cool

526
00:19:10,240 --> 00:19:12,240
self-promoting my own assets here it's

527
00:19:12,240 --> 00:19:13,520
not so often that i mentioned them

528
00:19:13,520 --> 00:19:15,760
actually

529
00:19:16,000 --> 00:19:17,679
okay we're seeing that it's missing the

530
00:19:17,679 --> 00:19:19,440
target and it's because the target's a

531
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:20,480
little bit too small

532
00:19:20,480 --> 00:19:22,640
so maybe i'll just increase the size of

533
00:19:22,640 --> 00:19:25,360
those targets

534
00:19:25,360 --> 00:19:28,880
test target we'll do scale maybe

535
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:33,760
1.5 instead should that work

536
00:19:33,760 --> 00:19:39,840
let's try it

537
00:19:40,080 --> 00:19:42,559
there we go

538
00:19:50,240 --> 00:19:52,559
okay and it looks a little bit different

539
00:19:52,559 --> 00:19:53,760
is because i don't have the same

540
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:55,600
texture settings that i did so if we go

541
00:19:55,600 --> 00:19:58,000
into this object or the material

542
00:19:58,000 --> 00:19:59,840
then this is probably the way it looked

543
00:19:59,840 --> 00:20:02,320
one one

544
00:20:02,559 --> 00:20:04,960
and zero zero here and this is a little

545
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:06,640
bit more similar to what it looked like

546
00:20:06,640 --> 00:20:10,159
when it was in a blender

547
00:20:10,159 --> 00:20:11,440
but you can play around with this as

548
00:20:11,440 --> 00:20:13,360
well so on this texture now you can just

549
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,240
slide

550
00:20:14,240 --> 00:20:16,880
on the tiling for example and that'll

551
00:20:16,880 --> 00:20:18,640
change the way it looks a little bit

552
00:20:18,640 --> 00:20:21,120
could get some pretty cool looking

553
00:20:21,120 --> 00:20:22,480
styles on it let's

554
00:20:22,480 --> 00:20:24,559
see we can see both here i remember now

555
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,080
you wouldn't want to have it like this

556
00:20:26,080 --> 00:20:26,720
of course

557
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:28,240
you can't go this close to this turret

558
00:20:28,240 --> 00:20:30,000
that looks uh not so good

559
00:20:30,000 --> 00:20:31,919
so but from a distance like this in a

560
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,919
game if you're making that mobile game

561
00:20:33,919 --> 00:20:35,919
or something then it works

562
00:20:35,919 --> 00:20:38,159
but like i said we'll just slide this so

563
00:20:38,159 --> 00:20:39,919
we can change the offset as well that

564
00:20:39,919 --> 00:20:41,360
pans the texture

565
00:20:41,360 --> 00:20:42,880
so you can find some interesting looking

566
00:20:42,880 --> 00:20:45,600
shapes down there

567
00:20:46,720 --> 00:20:49,520
this audio thing is annoying that a lot

568
00:20:49,520 --> 00:20:50,240
out of me

569
00:20:50,240 --> 00:20:52,880
so let's uh hide this one gizmos will

570
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:53,600
hide on

571
00:20:53,600 --> 00:20:55,760
so

572
00:20:56,799 --> 00:20:59,919
turrets and again slide tiling

573
00:20:59,919 --> 00:21:01,360
play around with that one get an

574
00:21:01,360 --> 00:21:03,840
interesting look

575
00:21:04,400 --> 00:21:06,799
and you can slide around the offset to

576
00:21:06,799 --> 00:21:08,159
pan it

577
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,679
and if you want it to be more solid

578
00:21:09,679 --> 00:21:11,600
colors you go down with the tiling down

579
00:21:11,600 --> 00:21:13,360
to something really small in both values

580
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,080
here

581
00:21:14,080 --> 00:21:15,679
then you get more solid colors because

582
00:21:15,679 --> 00:21:17,360
it's basically like zooming into the

583
00:21:17,360 --> 00:21:18,159
texture

584
00:21:18,159 --> 00:21:20,159
so now it looks like it's got some vents

585
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:21,360
that's probably let's

586
00:21:21,360 --> 00:21:22,799
press play on this one and see that

587
00:21:22,799 --> 00:21:24,720
looks a bit crisper i guess

588
00:21:24,720 --> 00:21:31,039
but still some different looks to it

589
00:21:31,039 --> 00:21:32,480
and if it's taking too long to shoot

590
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:33,919
these we could actually duplicate this

591
00:21:33,919 --> 00:21:34,799
one

592
00:21:34,799 --> 00:21:37,360
so let's just make a copy of this one

593
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:38,480
and put it

594
00:21:38,480 --> 00:21:39,760
two to the side there we've got two

595
00:21:39,760 --> 00:21:40,960
turrets maybe this one should be a

596
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,159
little bit different

597
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:45,440
we'll do one that rotates faster

598
00:21:45,440 --> 00:21:47,600
so turret here maybe the tracking speed

599
00:21:47,600 --> 00:21:49,360
is five

600
00:21:49,360 --> 00:21:52,000
but it wrote it only fires like 60 shots

601
00:21:52,000 --> 00:21:53,200
per minute

602
00:21:53,200 --> 00:21:54,320
and then we'll do another one here as

603
00:21:54,320 --> 00:21:56,320
well that we put next to it on the other

604
00:21:56,320 --> 00:21:57,280
side

605
00:21:57,280 --> 00:21:59,280
and then we'll change the parameters on

606
00:21:59,280 --> 00:22:01,600
this one we'll do rounds per minute it's

607
00:22:01,600 --> 00:22:03,760
going to be like 600

608
00:22:03,760 --> 00:22:07,200
but targeting speed is super slow one

609
00:22:07,200 --> 00:22:13,760
let's try this

610
00:22:13,760 --> 00:22:16,960
okay some targets so

611
00:22:16,960 --> 00:22:20,000
some different things to play around

612
00:22:20,000 --> 00:22:27,840
with there

613
00:22:38,159 --> 00:22:40,240
okay and now that we've got multiple

614
00:22:40,240 --> 00:22:41,600
sometimes when you have more objects

615
00:22:41,600 --> 00:22:43,039
than one as well not only the symmetry

616
00:22:43,039 --> 00:22:43,600
make it look

617
00:22:43,600 --> 00:22:45,440
pretty cool but when you have multiple

618
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:46,720
objects they look

619
00:22:46,720 --> 00:22:48,559
nice together as well so we can change

620
00:22:48,559 --> 00:22:49,760
the look of those

621
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,440
with the sliding just the offset here

622
00:22:51,440 --> 00:22:54,240
panning and the tiling again

623
00:22:54,240 --> 00:22:56,320
to whichever way you want we should try

624
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:57,600
the different colors here as well

625
00:22:57,600 --> 00:23:00,000
so not entirely sure that this will look

626
00:23:00,000 --> 00:23:00,960
so good so

627
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:02,640
but we'll try the blue one that we had

628
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,320
before there we go

629
00:23:04,320 --> 00:23:06,720
blue texture and then we'll go this

630
00:23:06,720 --> 00:23:08,640
changes for all of them so let's

631
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:12,000
see let's see what we've got here

632
00:23:12,000 --> 00:23:15,200
on these then you get get that little

633
00:23:15,200 --> 00:23:17,360
like a team color look maybe if you add

634
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:18,559
that one

635
00:23:18,559 --> 00:23:22,640
change the panning again

636
00:23:22,640 --> 00:23:25,360
there maybe looks like it's got some uh

637
00:23:25,360 --> 00:23:28,159
head there that's looking

638
00:23:28,159 --> 00:23:29,679
there we go let's try the other one as

639
00:23:29,679 --> 00:23:32,240
well we've got

640
00:23:32,240 --> 00:23:34,720
the orange one what's that look like so

641
00:23:34,720 --> 00:23:36,080
it doesn't look so orange it's because

642
00:23:36,080 --> 00:23:38,799
we've panned it somewhere

643
00:23:38,799 --> 00:23:41,840
change the tiling one on

644
00:23:41,840 --> 00:23:44,880
and then here change

645
00:23:44,880 --> 00:23:46,640
there it looks like an industrial robot

646
00:23:46,640 --> 00:23:48,480
type thing now so

647
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,159
it will actually won't maximize it on

648
00:23:50,159 --> 00:23:52,000
play so we can see both here

649
00:23:52,000 --> 00:23:55,520
the scene view and the top view

650
00:23:58,640 --> 00:24:00,559
and it tracks the active part here as

651
00:24:00,559 --> 00:24:05,840
well if it's closest

652
00:24:07,360 --> 00:24:08,720
let's import the other one as well we'll

653
00:24:08,720 --> 00:24:11,600
make a copy out of this one

654
00:24:11,600 --> 00:24:13,200
maybe we'll put these up here to the

655
00:24:13,200 --> 00:24:15,200
side

656
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:17,679
this can be like one team and then we'll

657
00:24:17,679 --> 00:24:18,960
do

658
00:24:18,960 --> 00:24:23,520
copy this one move that one down there

659
00:24:23,520 --> 00:24:26,640
spin it around around the y axis 180

660
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,640
and then here i'll just swap these now

661
00:24:28,640 --> 00:24:29,919
for the other

662
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:33,200
so we'll go base mesh here

663
00:24:33,200 --> 00:24:36,720
we'll do turret two base

664
00:24:36,720 --> 00:24:38,320
and then for the turret here we'll do

665
00:24:38,320 --> 00:24:40,559
turret two top

666
00:24:40,559 --> 00:24:45,120
and barrel turret two barrel

667
00:24:45,200 --> 00:24:47,520
and this one we need to change those uh

668
00:24:47,520 --> 00:24:49,120
muzzles as well since the

669
00:24:49,120 --> 00:24:50,559
the they're placed a little bit

670
00:24:50,559 --> 00:24:52,720
different so we'll go

671
00:24:52,720 --> 00:24:56,880
barrel here no no no no no no they're

672
00:24:56,880 --> 00:24:58,640
it's a little bit similar but not in the

673
00:24:58,640 --> 00:25:00,080
same place so remember click on

674
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:01,200
perspective

675
00:25:01,200 --> 00:25:03,200
and this is not a tutorial but i say

676
00:25:03,200 --> 00:25:04,720
anyway like that

677
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,360
so move it into the center and then go

678
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,279
from the front view

679
00:25:09,279 --> 00:25:11,919
okay that was the back here there's the

680
00:25:11,919 --> 00:25:13,279
front here

681
00:25:13,279 --> 00:25:16,000
oh yeah i'm looking from the other side

682
00:25:16,000 --> 00:25:17,600
of course

683
00:25:17,600 --> 00:25:20,400
okay let's go from the side then there

684
00:25:20,400 --> 00:25:21,679
we go

685
00:25:21,679 --> 00:25:25,760
and then we'll do copy position

686
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:28,159
paste onto the right one these are just

687
00:25:28,159 --> 00:25:30,159
the placeholders

688
00:25:30,159 --> 00:25:32,480
and then flip the y or the x component

689
00:25:32,480 --> 00:25:33,520
there so

690
00:25:33,520 --> 00:25:36,400
then now we should have it in that place

691
00:25:36,400 --> 00:25:37,039
and

692
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,640
we could create uh maybe a separate

693
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:40,080
texture for this one so we can control

694
00:25:40,080 --> 00:25:40,960
them so they look

695
00:25:40,960 --> 00:25:43,360
different i don't know why i have two

696
00:25:43,360 --> 00:25:45,520
pictures there

697
00:25:45,520 --> 00:25:48,799
start two and here we can put

698
00:25:48,799 --> 00:25:50,720
let's try the white texture that we had

699
00:25:50,720 --> 00:25:52,320
white

700
00:25:52,320 --> 00:25:54,640
and then for turret two here we'll

701
00:25:54,640 --> 00:25:56,400
select these three base turret and

702
00:25:56,400 --> 00:25:56,880
barrel

703
00:25:56,880 --> 00:26:01,200
and replace that with part two texture

704
00:26:01,440 --> 00:26:03,200
then we've got independent control out

705
00:26:03,200 --> 00:26:04,480
of this one maybe we'll do

706
00:26:04,480 --> 00:26:06,880
duplicates here as well so ctrl d to

707
00:26:06,880 --> 00:26:10,240
duplicate that

708
00:26:10,240 --> 00:26:11,840
and these won't fire on each other now

709
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:13,679
because i haven't uh configured

710
00:26:13,679 --> 00:26:16,159
the other ones as targets so but that

711
00:26:16,159 --> 00:26:18,240
could be a simple fix if we wanted to

712
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,000
put that one should they they should be

713
00:26:20,000 --> 00:26:21,760
a little further apart maybe minus

714
00:26:21,760 --> 00:26:24,960
four and four

715
00:26:24,960 --> 00:26:26,480
and these have different rotation speeds

716
00:26:26,480 --> 00:26:27,840
now maybe we'll give them some different

717
00:26:27,840 --> 00:26:30,480
properties too

718
00:26:32,000 --> 00:26:35,440
so turret here let's do

719
00:26:35,679 --> 00:26:38,960
super fast tracking or no not super fast

720
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,279
but eight

721
00:26:41,279 --> 00:26:45,360
and then rounds per minute how many

722
00:26:45,360 --> 00:26:47,520
120 that's pretty good oh that's going

723
00:26:47,520 --> 00:26:48,960
to be a dangerous turret

724
00:26:48,960 --> 00:26:52,960
this one

725
00:26:52,960 --> 00:26:56,120
we'll do two can remain there let's do

726
00:26:56,120 --> 00:26:57,360
320.

727
00:26:57,360 --> 00:27:00,559
okay never mind let's just give it less

728
00:27:00,559 --> 00:27:02,320
sorry two we can change around here with

729
00:27:02,320 --> 00:27:04,080
the tiling as well and look what do we

730
00:27:04,080 --> 00:27:04,559
like

731
00:27:04,559 --> 00:27:08,880
on these and the offsets

732
00:27:08,880 --> 00:27:11,360
offset this panning and tiling makes it

733
00:27:11,360 --> 00:27:12,320
more or less

734
00:27:12,320 --> 00:27:14,240
solid colors and details you can go

735
00:27:14,240 --> 00:27:15,760
negative as well so it starts to go more

736
00:27:15,760 --> 00:27:16,960
detail again

737
00:27:16,960 --> 00:27:20,640
but maybe like this would be

738
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:23,039
so we should separate these turrets a

739
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,200
little bit too

740
00:27:25,200 --> 00:27:28,960
three minus three there we go

741
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:35,520
so now we've got two turret types here

742
00:27:35,520 --> 00:27:39,600
and they're firing together

743
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:41,760
i've also made it so that it plays the

744
00:27:41,760 --> 00:27:43,760
animation based on the speed of the

745
00:27:43,760 --> 00:27:45,440
rounds per minute it calculates how fast

746
00:27:45,440 --> 00:27:47,120
it should play the animation

747
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:49,919
and uh again if you're uh so if you want

748
00:27:49,919 --> 00:27:51,520
to download this unity project

749
00:27:51,520 --> 00:27:53,360
uh you can become a patreon at

750
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:55,279
patreon.com infensia

751
00:27:55,279 --> 00:27:57,039
and i've already uploaded this unity

752
00:27:57,039 --> 00:27:58,559
project so you can have a play with it

753
00:27:58,559 --> 00:27:59,120
and see

754
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:00,399
maybe you'll learn from it or maybe you

755
00:28:00,399 --> 00:28:02,000
want to copy some logic and build on it

756
00:28:02,000 --> 00:28:05,600
and make a tower defense game why not

757
00:28:08,640 --> 00:28:10,000
we can also change the sound effects

758
00:28:10,000 --> 00:28:12,720
let's put these on

759
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:15,919
so for like a turret here maybe we'll

760
00:28:15,919 --> 00:28:17,279
disable a few of these

761
00:28:17,279 --> 00:28:19,520
so we can test some different turret

762
00:28:19,520 --> 00:28:22,799
sounds so i'll just

763
00:28:23,440 --> 00:28:26,240
shift select these

764
00:28:26,720 --> 00:28:29,120
and here i've just done so in the turret

765
00:28:29,120 --> 00:28:29,760
script

766
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:31,840
i've got a few audio clips here that i

767
00:28:31,840 --> 00:28:33,279
can randomize

768
00:28:33,279 --> 00:28:35,679
and in the blaster sound effects library

769
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,279
whoa whoa whoa

770
00:28:37,279 --> 00:28:39,520
or x round robin it means that every

771
00:28:39,520 --> 00:28:41,440
sound effect has got four variations to

772
00:28:41,440 --> 00:28:42,559
it because when you repeat

773
00:28:42,559 --> 00:28:44,720
firing sounds rapidly you don't want it

774
00:28:44,720 --> 00:28:46,240
to sound like a typewriter

775
00:28:46,240 --> 00:28:48,000
so if you knew some slight variation to

776
00:28:48,000 --> 00:28:49,440
it and randomized between those

777
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:50,480
different samples it

778
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:52,480
sounds a little bit better so let's go

779
00:28:52,480 --> 00:28:54,000
into the medium folder here

780
00:28:54,000 --> 00:28:56,960
and go loud and then i'll just drag some

781
00:28:56,960 --> 00:28:58,559
more sound effects in here

782
00:28:58,559 --> 00:29:00,080
so i'll include these as well you can

783
00:29:00,080 --> 00:29:01,760
use them if you download this

784
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,960
from patreon you can use the sound

785
00:29:02,960 --> 00:29:04,399
effects if you want or you could buy

786
00:29:04,399 --> 00:29:04,960
that

787
00:29:04,960 --> 00:29:08,640
sound effects pack from infantia.com

788
00:29:09,760 --> 00:29:11,679
so there we go let's bring some sounds

789
00:29:11,679 --> 00:29:15,520
in let's just pick a random one here

790
00:29:17,679 --> 00:29:19,200
i should pause that because i don't need

791
00:29:19,200 --> 00:29:21,520
it to fire so we'll pick yeah i have no

792
00:29:21,520 --> 00:29:27,279
idea maybe they'll try this one

793
00:29:27,279 --> 00:29:30,720
any random sound there quick way to do

794
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,159
there is just to go zero

795
00:29:32,159 --> 00:29:34,240
on the array click the little padlock

796
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:35,279
icon and we can

797
00:29:35,279 --> 00:29:37,679
select these and drag them into fire

798
00:29:37,679 --> 00:29:38,480
clips there

799
00:29:38,480 --> 00:29:41,840
and let's see what this sounds like

800
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:55,840
okay let's try another sound

801
00:29:56,480 --> 00:29:59,360
47 maybe

802
00:30:04,240 --> 00:30:07,200
zero let's grab these in if you can see

803
00:30:07,200 --> 00:30:09,919
them there we go

804
00:30:10,100 --> 00:30:13,220
[Music]

805
00:30:17,360 --> 00:30:19,039
okay should we do a totally different

806
00:30:19,039 --> 00:30:22,720
sound here maybe

807
00:30:22,720 --> 00:30:25,520
do a longer sound and some slower firing

808
00:30:25,520 --> 00:30:27,760
maybe

809
00:30:27,760 --> 00:30:32,399
so we'll go into the long and very loud

810
00:30:32,399 --> 00:30:34,799
long and

811
00:30:35,679 --> 00:30:37,919
just loud one this one low mid

812
00:30:37,919 --> 00:30:38,720
frequencies

813
00:30:38,720 --> 00:30:43,279
very loud there we go

814
00:30:43,279 --> 00:30:46,720
zero on there really a railing

815
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:51,840
oh i missed one but never mind

816
00:30:55,200 --> 00:30:57,760
that's pretty cool

817
00:31:01,360 --> 00:31:02,840
and we could give it some more damage as

818
00:31:02,840 --> 00:31:05,120
well

819
00:31:05,120 --> 00:31:07,200
oh i didn't expose the damage the health

820
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:09,440
of these

821
00:31:10,480 --> 00:31:12,240
and then if it works in unison but the

822
00:31:12,240 --> 00:31:19,360
other one with a different sound here

823
00:31:19,360 --> 00:31:33,840
oh yeah the padlock iphone

824
00:31:42,960 --> 00:31:47,840
oh he's inside one

825
00:32:12,840 --> 00:32:15,840
so

826
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:22,880
