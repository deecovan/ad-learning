00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,620
hello everyone and welcome back to yet

2
00:00:01,620 --> 00:00:03,240
another Thursday I'm gonna spend another

3
00:00:03,240 --> 00:00:05,069
ten minutes in blender I'm gonna model

4
00:00:05,069 --> 00:00:07,170
myself a car I don't even like the

5
00:00:07,170 --> 00:00:09,150
article what am i 12 I'm gonna set

6
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:11,519
myself aside ten minutes to create a

7
00:00:11,519 --> 00:00:13,590
bunch of cars I'm gonna try to make

8
00:00:13,590 --> 00:00:15,540
eight cars at least maybe even more

9
00:00:15,540 --> 00:00:17,789
let's see how that goes I'll just put

10
00:00:17,789 --> 00:00:19,380
some simple colors on them as well I'll

11
00:00:19,380 --> 00:00:21,000
use the simple UV technique that I've

12
00:00:21,000 --> 00:00:23,189
used in many of my other videos you can

13
00:00:23,189 --> 00:00:24,600
check out the link in the description if

14
00:00:24,600 --> 00:00:26,220
you want to see a little video where I

15
00:00:26,220 --> 00:00:28,410
set up my start scene it's very few

16
00:00:28,410 --> 00:00:30,570
tweets nothing complicated create a very

17
00:00:30,570 --> 00:00:32,549
simple texture I'll link to the texture

18
00:00:32,549 --> 00:00:34,410
file as well so you can download that

19
00:00:34,410 --> 00:00:36,210
one and I just make some viewport

20
00:00:36,210 --> 00:00:38,610
changes and add two add-ons now it's

21
00:00:38,610 --> 00:00:40,800
gonna be the bull tools really handy and

22
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:43,469
also the auto mirroring auto mirroring

23
00:00:43,469 --> 00:00:45,180
so thanks a lot for everyone who

24
00:00:45,180 --> 00:00:46,680
suggested that I should start using

25
00:00:46,680 --> 00:00:48,629
those they are actually saving time but

26
00:00:48,629 --> 00:00:50,160
without further ado let's get started

27
00:00:50,160 --> 00:00:52,410
straight away let's model some course go

28
00:00:52,410 --> 00:00:55,110
tap inside it mode a scale on the left

29
00:00:55,110 --> 00:00:57,329
side G and move it in green here scale a

30
00:00:57,329 --> 00:01:00,180
mesh why - and then let's grab the

31
00:01:00,180 --> 00:01:01,980
bottom face here shift space G and move

32
00:01:01,980 --> 00:01:05,119
it into place here and then now let's do

33
00:01:05,119 --> 00:01:07,799
ctrl e to subdivide the edges here and

34
00:01:07,799 --> 00:01:10,020
let's do two cuts here let's apply this

35
00:01:10,020 --> 00:01:12,570
one back e to extrude it up scale it

36
00:01:12,570 --> 00:01:14,520
down and then shift right click here

37
00:01:14,520 --> 00:01:16,890
shift a for a cylinder let's change it

38
00:01:16,890 --> 00:01:21,259
10 faces are wide 90 degrees side view

39
00:01:21,259 --> 00:01:24,780
control and then rotate it on our scale

40
00:01:24,780 --> 00:01:26,310
it down for the wheel houses here that

41
00:01:26,310 --> 00:01:28,530
should be okay and I changed the color

42
00:01:28,530 --> 00:01:30,840
here to green as well I'll make better

43
00:01:30,840 --> 00:01:33,180
cut shift D duplicate it move it to here

44
00:01:33,180 --> 00:01:36,420
and then now with L and then let's see

45
00:01:36,420 --> 00:01:39,030
I'm okay there move it out a bit P

46
00:01:39,030 --> 00:01:41,070
separated to an object select this

47
00:01:41,070 --> 00:01:43,680
object shift select on ctrl shift - and

48
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:46,860
then now let's do auto mirror for this

49
00:01:46,860 --> 00:01:49,860
one yeah that's good and go into edit

50
00:01:49,860 --> 00:01:52,229
mode again the shift tab move forward

51
00:01:52,229 --> 00:01:55,200
from you make a bumper here and scale it

52
00:01:55,200 --> 00:01:58,110
down G to move it down and G to move it

53
00:01:58,110 --> 00:01:58,710
up to here

54
00:01:58,710 --> 00:02:01,950
make it great shift the G move it here

55
00:02:01,950 --> 00:02:03,920
let's make it white for a number plate

56
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:07,409
shift D again right click and then

57
00:02:07,409 --> 00:02:09,270
disable clipping here make headlights

58
00:02:09,270 --> 00:02:10,179
shift

59
00:02:10,179 --> 00:02:12,549
actually make that one yellow 50 make a

60
00:02:12,549 --> 00:02:14,219
rear-view mirror scale it down a bit

61
00:02:14,219 --> 00:02:16,480
change that one to green as well let's

62
00:02:16,480 --> 00:02:18,250
get it done and then let's move this

63
00:02:18,250 --> 00:02:19,810
mirror back to here where it needs to be

64
00:02:19,810 --> 00:02:22,810
and now actually shifty let's make a

65
00:02:22,810 --> 00:02:24,730
door handle as well so these are just

66
00:02:24,730 --> 00:02:26,170
faces for now we're going to change

67
00:02:26,170 --> 00:02:29,250
those in a second shapes big scale X

68
00:02:29,250 --> 00:02:31,959
into there and move it back to here and

69
00:02:31,959 --> 00:02:34,299
then change that on the gray now I'll

70
00:02:34,299 --> 00:02:37,120
shift select all of these eat extrude

71
00:02:37,120 --> 00:02:40,569
them and control R let's make this one

72
00:02:40,569 --> 00:02:43,120
ctrl + very well make an indicator light

73
00:02:43,120 --> 00:02:45,639
here and for the rearview mirror here

74
00:02:45,639 --> 00:02:48,879
let's do I - insect eat extrude in and

75
00:02:48,879 --> 00:02:50,769
change it to a blue window color there

76
00:02:50,769 --> 00:02:53,439
and then e to extrude or a glass color

77
00:02:53,439 --> 00:02:58,000
scale move it down from you G okay and

78
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:01,480
now let's do select L here select all

79
00:03:01,480 --> 00:03:03,400
these linked ones shifty and duplicate

80
00:03:03,400 --> 00:03:05,530
them for the back here and that should

81
00:03:05,530 --> 00:03:08,730
be okay and then L to select this one

82
00:03:08,730 --> 00:03:10,810
select the yellow here and change that

83
00:03:10,810 --> 00:03:12,790
one to read for the taillight now we

84
00:03:12,790 --> 00:03:14,979
need a wheel so shift space cursor to

85
00:03:14,979 --> 00:03:17,500
selected side view shift a cylinder and

86
00:03:17,500 --> 00:03:20,109
let's rotate click thing is off that's

87
00:03:20,109 --> 00:03:24,459
good rotate Y 90 scale it down G scale

88
00:03:24,459 --> 00:03:26,049
it up that's okay

89
00:03:26,049 --> 00:03:29,409
clipping back on scale X move it into

90
00:03:29,409 --> 00:03:34,060
place and a scale movies to zero make

91
00:03:34,060 --> 00:03:39,069
tire it--in set eat extrude you know the

92
00:03:39,069 --> 00:03:41,379
gentle it--in set to eat extrude ctrl +

93
00:03:41,379 --> 00:03:44,379
twice change the rim color to gray shift

94
00:03:44,379 --> 00:03:46,780
select a few of the spokes here eat

95
00:03:46,780 --> 00:03:49,269
extrude and change that to black side

96
00:03:49,269 --> 00:03:52,720
view again and then L to select the

97
00:03:52,720 --> 00:03:54,579
whole wheel shift B and move it into

98
00:03:54,579 --> 00:03:57,040
place here and then now we need to

99
00:03:57,040 --> 00:03:58,900
duplicate this car so I'll tap out to

100
00:03:58,900 --> 00:04:00,430
that one make sure clipping is on you

101
00:04:00,430 --> 00:04:03,909
shift the X minus three and then do

102
00:04:03,909 --> 00:04:06,729
let's a whole bunch of cars 2 3 4 5 6 7

103
00:04:06,729 --> 00:04:10,269
8 9 10 ok and then let's edit this one

104
00:04:10,269 --> 00:04:13,500
delete to focus on it how am i doing 641

105
00:04:13,500 --> 00:04:15,970
control-r it's okay

106
00:04:15,970 --> 00:04:18,909
and then that one's done I think so next

107
00:04:18,909 --> 00:04:22,029
car let's make a little smart career 7

108
00:04:22,029 --> 00:04:25,330
one all set to see all the vertices here

109
00:04:25,330 --> 00:04:27,700
slide this one into place make a little

110
00:04:27,700 --> 00:04:28,480
bit smaller

111
00:04:28,480 --> 00:04:30,940
all set again to see it smooth this

112
00:04:30,940 --> 00:04:33,070
whole thing forward including the door

113
00:04:33,070 --> 00:04:35,710
handle actually the door handle can't go

114
00:04:35,710 --> 00:04:39,070
forward Kenny slide this one back

115
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:41,350
control or make a window here actually

116
00:04:41,350 --> 00:04:42,880
let's bring the roof down there's gonna

117
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:45,010
be a small car like actually if its

118
00:04:45,010 --> 00:04:46,540
color Isis as well they should be pink

119
00:04:46,540 --> 00:04:50,889
maybe okay next car let's make an estate

120
00:04:50,889 --> 00:04:53,950
here so tub move on forward this one

121
00:04:53,950 --> 00:04:58,300
forward and you need to mirror forward

122
00:04:58,300 --> 00:04:58,780
as well

123
00:04:58,780 --> 00:05:01,780
now select a vertex here and snap them

124
00:05:01,780 --> 00:05:05,050
into place here for the estate or the

125
00:05:05,050 --> 00:05:06,730
station wagon or slide this one back

126
00:05:06,730 --> 00:05:09,540
control our let's make some more windows

127
00:05:09,540 --> 00:05:12,490
else's like this one shift D to

128
00:05:12,490 --> 00:05:14,830
duplicate it a let's change the whole

129
00:05:14,830 --> 00:05:18,880
color okay now let's make pickup truck

130
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:21,460
so let's bring that actually just bring

131
00:05:21,460 --> 00:05:23,620
the whole forward this one needs to go

132
00:05:23,620 --> 00:05:24,790
forward and that one too

133
00:05:24,790 --> 00:05:27,970
so 527 let's bring this one forward as

134
00:05:27,970 --> 00:05:32,130
well but on back of it and forward

135
00:05:32,130 --> 00:05:37,210
control our for the window here three I

136
00:05:37,210 --> 00:05:40,210
to in sets be to get that one center and

137
00:05:40,210 --> 00:05:41,740

we need to snap these all the way to the

146
00:06:05,950 --> 00:06:08,169
back here as well I keep getting it

147
00:06:08,169 --> 00:06:12,610

here on this roof and it's bringing out

162
00:06:55,289 --> 00:06:58,990
fact e to extrude ctrl + and then change

163
00:06:58,990 --> 00:07:02,439
that color to blue and then ctrl R or a

164
00:07:02,439 --> 00:07:06,210

let's bring this down a bit k for a

173
00:07:31,210 --> 00:07:35,080
knife cut up there 3 e to extrude s to

174
00:07:35,080 --> 00:07:39,250
scale and inset here and make it out a

175
00:07:39,250 --> 00:07:44,830
bit scale Y e to extrude is gonna be a

176
00:07:44,830 --> 00:07:46,389
big intake here so it's gonna be a

177
00:07:46,389 --> 00:07:50,620
muscle car G do ITIN set this one and

actually do I have a window for the

181
00:07:59,770 --> 00:08:01,980
under control

182
00:08:01,980 --> 00:08:06,920
so 250 so limousine here for this one on

183
00:08:06,920 --> 00:08:12,420
top view here and one for Bob said to

184
00:08:12,420 --> 00:08:15,450
see everything bring all the way back to

185
00:08:15,450 --> 00:08:19,230
their old said bring this foot down a

186
00:08:19,230 --> 00:08:24,720
select everything make a limo here

187
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:29,130
let's hit ctrl R which makes one shift

188
00:08:29,130 --> 00:08:32,220
space a few those and then now let's

189
00:08:32,220 --> 00:08:36,419
make Lori if I can't bring that on

190
00:08:36,419 --> 00:08:40,049
forward bring this one forward and we

191
00:08:40,049 --> 00:08:43,789
need to shift this forward out there and

192
00:08:43,789 --> 00:08:47,880
see top view outside two minutes ago

193
00:08:47,880 --> 00:08:51,140
vote let's make a lawyer here somehow

194
00:08:51,140 --> 00:08:56,910
outside again three ITIN sets oh no

195
00:08:56,910 --> 00:08:59,510
actually let's do a little cardio just

196
00:08:59,510 --> 00:09:03,300
there eat to extrude make it a bit

197
00:09:03,300 --> 00:09:05,340
higher and back maybe we have to control

198
00:09:05,340 --> 00:09:08,370
our and just bring this one in as well

199
00:09:08,370 --> 00:09:11,190
okay and now let's just make a little

200
00:09:11,190 --> 00:09:13,980
house back here ago so I got 140 do we

201
00:09:13,980 --> 00:09:15,360
need to change the color here so a

202
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,220
select everything let's just make a

203
00:09:17,220 --> 00:09:19,830
white lawyer or a great one and then our

204
00:09:19,830 --> 00:09:21,750
hatch back here now as well I've got 130

205
00:09:21,750 --> 00:09:23,310
to go I need to do the windows as well

206
00:09:23,310 --> 00:09:26,880
so I'll just do control snap that onto

207
00:09:26,880 --> 00:09:29,820
there and snap that one today move this

208
00:09:29,820 --> 00:09:33,210
one back and down control art that

209
00:09:33,210 --> 00:09:34,950
should do okay and then you need to

210
00:09:34,950 --> 00:09:39,630
change the color so 117 yeah okay let's

211
00:09:39,630 --> 00:09:41,030
do all the front windows now so I'll

212
00:09:41,030 --> 00:09:43,500
select all the vehicles tab into edit

213
00:09:43,500 --> 00:09:45,840
mode on all of them shift select all the

214
00:09:45,840 --> 00:09:50,640
front windows one minute four seconds to

215
00:09:50,640 --> 00:09:52,440
go let's do all the rear windows here as

216
00:09:52,440 --> 00:09:54,220
well

217
00:09:54,220 --> 00:09:57,710
I'm shaking now I can no not that one

218
00:09:57,710 --> 00:10:01,610
all of these windows 54 seconds I to

219
00:10:01,610 --> 00:10:06,080
inset Denmark right in set alt e' to

220
00:10:06,080 --> 00:10:11,510
extruding normals and then a scale 0 42

221
00:10:11,510 --> 00:10:14,990
seconds to go let's do all the side

222
00:10:14,990 --> 00:10:18,530
windows now as well so shift-click all

223
00:10:18,530 --> 00:10:28,310
of these 33 seconds to go here and then

224
00:10:28,310 --> 00:10:31,490
I to inset and iTunes that again so

225
00:10:31,490 --> 00:10:33,350
against individuals yeah that's right

226
00:10:33,350 --> 00:10:36,470
19 seconds ulti extrude long normals

227
00:10:36,470 --> 00:10:41,980
found there a scale 13 seconds to go

228
00:10:41,980 --> 00:10:45,890
g-get the window color there and we're

229
00:10:45,890 --> 00:10:46,310
done

230
00:10:46,310 --> 00:10:48,200
I've got 6 seconds to spare what should

231
00:10:48,200 --> 00:10:53,360
I do ah ok

232
00:10:53,360 --> 00:10:55,610
time's up hope I didn't forget anything

233
00:10:55,610 --> 00:11:02,150
though my ambition was to do eight

234
00:11:02,150 --> 00:11:04,430
course but then I thought maybe I can

235
00:11:04,430 --> 00:11:05,840
make 10 but another one down in the

236
00:11:05,840 --> 00:11:08,000
books guys so maybe not as close as the

237
00:11:08,000 --> 00:11:09,620
last one but a little bit too close for

238
00:11:09,620 --> 00:11:11,900
comfort yet again so I seem to be

239
00:11:11,900 --> 00:11:13,580
impossible I hope I didn't break any

240
00:11:13,580 --> 00:11:16,220
geometry again the topology is not

241
00:11:16,220 --> 00:11:17,810
really up to spec if you want to do a

242
00:11:17,810 --> 00:11:19,850
subdividing and things like that pour a

243
00:11:19,850 --> 00:11:21,680
low poly game or a prototype this should

244
00:11:21,680 --> 00:11:23,540
be perfectly fine or a mobile game the

245
00:11:23,540 --> 00:11:24,980
topology is only important if you want

246
00:11:24,980 --> 00:11:27,200
to add detail or if you want to change

247
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:29,180
the mesh for example bend it or

248
00:11:29,180 --> 00:11:29,900
something like that

249
00:11:29,900 --> 00:11:31,310
and that's not really going to be the

250
00:11:31,310 --> 00:11:33,410
case in this so this type of topology

251
00:11:33,410 --> 00:11:34,730
should work perfectly fine if you just

252
00:11:34,730 --> 00:11:36,680
want to have those cars driving around

253
00:11:36,680 --> 00:11:38,420
on a mobile phone game or something like

254
00:11:38,420 --> 00:11:40,040
that oh guys I nearly forgot to give you

255
00:11:40,040 --> 00:11:41,540
a tip as well this week but let's bring

256
00:11:41,540 --> 00:11:43,730
one in so something I did in this one

257
00:11:43,730 --> 00:11:45,710
was I grabbed one of the cars let's

258
00:11:45,710 --> 00:11:47,300
enter on this one with a Delete key and

259
00:11:47,300 --> 00:11:50,120
I pressed shift D and then instead of

260
00:11:50,120 --> 00:11:51,950
moving it into place I wanted to snap it

261
00:11:51,950 --> 00:11:55,010
by a secure distance so I pressed X and

262
00:11:55,010 --> 00:11:57,530
then I typed -3 to give it adequate

263
00:11:57,530 --> 00:11:59,780
space between the cars and then what I

264
00:11:59,780 --> 00:12:02,090
did was I pressed shift are a few times

265
00:12:02,090 --> 00:12:04,210
because I wanted to duplicate the action

266
00:12:04,210 --> 00:12:06,520
and shift our is repeating the previous

267
00:12:06,520 --> 00:12:09,370
action so that'll do the same duplicate

268
00:12:09,370 --> 00:12:12,040
X minus three and and I did that ten

269
00:12:12,040 --> 00:12:13,960
times to create the ten cars you could

270
00:12:13,960 --> 00:12:15,880
use the array modifier but I don't want

271
00:12:15,880 --> 00:12:17,620
to use that one for this because if I

272
00:12:17,620 --> 00:12:19,360
use the array modifier then I've also

273
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:21,459
gotten a mirror modifier on it and that

274
00:12:21,459 --> 00:12:22,839
would basically duplicate the whole

275
00:12:22,839 --> 00:12:24,790
bunch of half mirrored cars and it

276
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:26,470
breaks it alright guys thanks a lot for

277
00:12:26,470 --> 00:12:28,420
