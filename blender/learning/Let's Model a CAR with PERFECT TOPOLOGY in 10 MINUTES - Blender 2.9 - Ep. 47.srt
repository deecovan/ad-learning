00:00:00,640 --> 00:00:03,040
hello guys and welcome to episode four

2
00:00:03,040 --> 00:00:04,960
is it 47 i keep saying it wrong yes it

3
00:00:04,960 --> 00:00:07,839
is hello guys and welcome to episode 47

4
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,360
of the 10 minute modeling challenge this

5
00:00:09,360 --> 00:00:11,440
time it really is number 47. i said it

6
00:00:11,440 --> 00:00:12,719
wrong last week but never mind

7
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,880
in this video i'm gonna try to do the

8
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,800
impossible i'm gonna in 10 minutes

9
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,880
create a perfect topology car

10
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,439
with all the quads and i'm gonna nail it

11
00:00:21,439 --> 00:00:22,400
hopefully

12
00:00:22,400 --> 00:00:23,920
let's see how that goes well i've done a

13
00:00:23,920 --> 00:00:25,920
lot of low poly cars before but i really

14
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,599
wanted to find a way to

15
00:00:27,599 --> 00:00:30,000
to model cars quickly and keep that

16
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,679
perfect topology and i've never really

17
00:00:31,679 --> 00:00:32,640
been a fan

18
00:00:32,640 --> 00:00:34,399
where you have to actually model like

19
00:00:34,399 --> 00:00:35,920
the side or splines

20
00:00:35,920 --> 00:00:37,280
connect them all together and try to

21
00:00:37,280 --> 00:00:38,879
keep that quad topology and i've always

22
00:00:38,879 --> 00:00:40,160
heard that you shouldn't use

23
00:00:40,160 --> 00:00:42,559
a box method to model cars and i've

24
00:00:42,559 --> 00:00:44,000
actually always thought myself i can't

25
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,039
really create a nice

26
00:00:45,039 --> 00:00:47,520
looking car with a box modeling but i

27
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:49,360
spent a bit of time now and i've

28
00:00:49,360 --> 00:00:51,600
thought of how it must be possible and i

29
00:00:51,600 --> 00:00:52,800
think i've found a method

30
00:00:52,800 --> 00:00:55,199
to do it so make sure you stick around

31
00:00:55,199 --> 00:00:56,640
now for this video and

32
00:00:56,640 --> 00:00:58,640
look at it to the end because gonna do

33
00:00:58,640 --> 00:01:00,480
the modeling and then i'm gonna show you

34
00:01:00,480 --> 00:01:02,320
the bonus material as well how

35
00:01:02,320 --> 00:01:04,159
you can actually work from that model

36
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,080
now and start using uh probably

37
00:01:06,080 --> 00:01:07,760
proportional editing to get it

38
00:01:07,760 --> 00:01:10,000
into doing some crazy stuff so make sure

39
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,040
you watch to the end now

40
00:01:11,040 --> 00:01:14,560
you've heard me check this out as well

41
00:01:14,560 --> 00:01:17,360
it's a book it's the sound of star wars

42
00:01:17,360 --> 00:01:19,040
check this out

43
00:01:19,040 --> 00:01:22,240
sound 125 it's the ray gun or the laser

44
00:01:22,240 --> 00:01:24,720
la serie in swedish of boba fett the

45
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,799
bounty hunter this whole book is full of

46
00:01:26,799 --> 00:01:28,479
cool stories how they record those sound

47
00:01:28,479 --> 00:01:30,159
effects and you might be surprised that

48
00:01:30,159 --> 00:01:31,600
everything that you hear in a film

49
00:01:31,600 --> 00:01:34,320
is fake for example take a gladiator you

50
00:01:34,320 --> 00:01:35,920
see a horse riding in you think that

51
00:01:35,920 --> 00:01:36,400
that's

52
00:01:36,400 --> 00:01:38,320
the sound of a real horse no no

53
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,680
obviously you've got the coconut thing

54
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:40,000
going

55
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,960
on with the with that well it doesn't

56
00:01:42,960 --> 00:01:44,159
sound like that now but

57
00:01:44,159 --> 00:01:45,920
the sword that he pulls out it's like a

58
00:01:45,920 --> 00:01:47,520
fish slice and when he rides

59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:50,000
his armor and uh sword and the shield

60
00:01:50,000 --> 00:01:51,680
and stuff that's just uh some

61
00:01:51,680 --> 00:01:53,600
rattling chains and some leather straps

62
00:01:53,600 --> 00:01:55,680
that someone's swinging

63
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:57,600
yeah even the horse sound itself you'd

64
00:01:57,600 --> 00:01:59,360
think that was a real horse but no no no

65
00:01:59,360 --> 00:02:00,159
it's the same guy

66
00:02:00,159 --> 00:02:04,399
who's like flapping the straps he's gone

67
00:02:05,680 --> 00:02:07,280
stuff like that so it's not even a real

68
00:02:07,280 --> 00:02:09,119
horse so all the sound effects all the

69
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:10,080
foley stuff

70
00:02:10,080 --> 00:02:12,239
is all fake so check that out as well

71
00:02:12,239 --> 00:02:13,680
google some videos on it and i might

72
00:02:13,680 --> 00:02:15,760
even feature some on a video on my own

73
00:02:15,760 --> 00:02:16,720
the lord of the rings

74
00:02:16,720 --> 00:02:18,560
flapping of a dragon's wing a cheese

75
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,080
crater on a string that they're swinging

76
00:02:20,080 --> 00:02:20,560
in the air

the new year so check that out it's like

102
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,959
a low poly style but really neat

103
00:03:00,959 --> 00:03:02,560
lush looking fireworks and i actually

104
00:03:02,560 --> 00:03:04,159
recorded a few of the sound effects that

105
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:05,360
i used i don't know if you're still

106
00:03:05,360 --> 00:03:06,959
using those ones check out that channel

107
00:03:06,959 --> 00:03:08,400
i'll put that in the description

108
00:03:08,400 --> 00:03:10,560
check out that game and then we had toot

109
00:03:10,560 --> 00:03:12,959
84 you said to buy some oreo cookies for

110
00:03:12,959 --> 00:03:14,000
the next stream

111
00:03:14,000 --> 00:03:15,760
smiley face thanks for all the nice

112
00:03:15,760 --> 00:03:17,440
content and thank you for that comment

113
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,200
and thanks for their donation because i

114
00:03:19,200 --> 00:03:21,200
actually bought myself some oreo cookies

115
00:03:21,200 --> 00:03:22,800
and i'd like to show them but i can't

116
00:03:22,800 --> 00:03:24,400
because i ate them and so did my kids

117
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:25,200
and my wife

118
00:03:25,200 --> 00:03:27,040
so we appreciate that thanks a lot all

119
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,799
right strap things on

120
00:03:28,799 --> 00:03:31,040
if that's what you do and uh let's get

121
00:03:31,040 --> 00:03:33,840
started

122
00:03:34,480 --> 00:03:36,319
i have no idea why i'm saying stuff like

123
00:03:36,319 --> 00:03:37,599
that

124
00:03:37,599 --> 00:03:39,519
okay for cars i've realized that the

125
00:03:39,519 --> 00:03:41,519
cavity setting isn't the best

126
00:03:41,519 --> 00:03:43,280
even though i've got the merch the

127
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,200
cavity shirt here with the default cube

128
00:03:45,200 --> 00:03:46,159
of course i'm going to start with the

129
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:47,040
default cube

130
00:03:47,040 --> 00:03:48,640
but i have to disable cavity for this

131
00:03:48,640 --> 00:03:50,239
one because it doesn't look so good for

132
00:03:50,239 --> 00:03:50,720
cars

133
00:03:50,720 --> 00:03:54,400
are you ready i'm ready let's get it on

134
00:03:54,400 --> 00:03:57,280
i used to watch uh ufc back in the day

135
00:03:57,280 --> 00:03:58,959
so here we go ready

136
00:03:58,959 --> 00:04:02,239
steady go when we're off yes and auto

137
00:04:02,239 --> 00:04:04,239
mirror as usual tab into edit mode

138
00:04:04,239 --> 00:04:08,239
scale y five move it up

139
00:04:08,239 --> 00:04:11,120
scale z flatten it and now we're gonna

140
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,640
do loop cutting

141
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:15,360
ctrl r loop cut one along here and then

142
00:04:15,360 --> 00:04:16,798
side view again ctrl r

143
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:19,918
let's put one here ctrl r put one there

144
00:04:19,918 --> 00:04:23,199
ctrl r ctrl r there

145
00:04:23,199 --> 00:04:24,400
and then one in the middle of each

146
00:04:24,400 --> 00:04:26,240
control r control r and then we need one

147
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,160
more loop cut ctrl r

148
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:30,639
here and i've said you shouldn't really

149
00:04:30,639 --> 00:04:32,639
use a box when you do

150
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:34,320
cars but i've changed my mind now i'm

151
00:04:34,320 --> 00:04:36,000
going to use probably this all the time

152
00:04:36,000 --> 00:04:37,120
though

153
00:04:37,120 --> 00:04:39,040
so eye to inset now and make sure you

154
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,400
press b

155
00:04:40,400 --> 00:04:42,080
for boundary so you connect it in the

156
00:04:42,080 --> 00:04:44,400
center there down below

157
00:04:44,400 --> 00:04:47,440
and now we can do side view double click

158
00:04:47,440 --> 00:04:48,320
a to d select

159
00:04:48,320 --> 00:04:50,400
b to box select just the side ones there

160
00:04:50,400 --> 00:04:53,120
shift and deselect these note

161
00:04:53,120 --> 00:04:56,160
and then e to extrude quite a bit to

162
00:04:56,160 --> 00:04:57,440
there and now we've actually got a

163
00:04:57,440 --> 00:04:58,800
pretty cool topology here

164
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:02,080
maybe i'll do alt select

165
00:05:02,080 --> 00:05:04,560
those bring that down slightly if i

166
00:05:04,560 --> 00:05:05,280
press

167
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:06,880
period make sure i've got medium point

168
00:05:06,880 --> 00:05:08,800
here and i'll shift select a bunch of

169
00:05:08,800 --> 00:05:10,080
these now i might

170
00:05:10,080 --> 00:05:12,240
yeah the time is actually running scale

171
00:05:12,240 --> 00:05:13,520
y axis

172
00:05:13,520 --> 00:05:16,639
to there select that one shift select

173
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,039
these

174
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:20,320
scale y there i'll just do roughly

175
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:23,039
the same and then shift select these and

176
00:05:23,039 --> 00:05:24,000
move them up slightly

177
00:05:24,000 --> 00:05:25,199
and now we've got pretty good wheel

178
00:05:25,199 --> 00:05:27,039
arches that the good thing about these

179
00:05:27,039 --> 00:05:28,960
wheel arches now is that you can

180
00:05:28,960 --> 00:05:32,400
they're real arches real wheel arches so

181
00:05:32,400 --> 00:05:34,639
if i control and shift select a few of

182
00:05:34,639 --> 00:05:36,320
these and then now we can bring this in

183
00:05:36,320 --> 00:05:37,680
and make those little wide

184
00:05:37,680 --> 00:05:39,919
things go in there so i'm gonna make a

185
00:05:39,919 --> 00:05:41,360
muscle car i'll um

186
00:05:41,360 --> 00:05:42,720
just come up with something on my own

187
00:05:42,720 --> 00:05:44,960
but i think i'll uh maybe like a dodge

188
00:05:44,960 --> 00:05:46,400
charger inspired

189
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:48,160
front or something where it is a little

190
00:05:48,160 --> 00:05:49,759
bit aggressive

191
00:05:49,759 --> 00:05:53,280
well maybe move this down to there

192
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:55,120
bring this forward get a little bit of a

193
00:05:55,120 --> 00:05:57,759
mean look that should do it

194
00:05:57,759 --> 00:05:59,680
and then here in the back we can fix

195
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,120
this in a second ctrl

196
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:04,560
r and now i'll shift select these and

197
00:06:04,560 --> 00:06:06,400
here's another trick now i to inset

198
00:06:06,400 --> 00:06:06,800
again

199
00:06:06,800 --> 00:06:08,960
with boundary like this so we get the

200
00:06:08,960 --> 00:06:10,479
center pretty good

201
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,880
and then e to extrude this one now and

202
00:06:12,880 --> 00:06:14,639
it looks like a limo now so i'll

203
00:06:14,639 --> 00:06:16,560
fix it a little bit but that's the scale

204
00:06:16,560 --> 00:06:17,919
e to extrude there

205
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,600
and then now let's shape it into a bit

206
00:06:19,600 --> 00:06:21,919
of a rounder shape

207
00:06:21,919 --> 00:06:25,360
so just shift select those and

208
00:06:25,360 --> 00:06:28,160
we can bring this forward quite a bit

209
00:06:28,160 --> 00:06:28,800
now i think

210
00:06:28,800 --> 00:06:32,400
so i'll select these whole faces

211
00:06:32,400 --> 00:06:34,080
and bring that to there and this one

212
00:06:34,080 --> 00:06:36,080
even further oop i'm gonna move that

213
00:06:36,080 --> 00:06:36,720
down maybe

214
00:06:36,720 --> 00:06:40,720
to there and forward both

215
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:42,160
that's it and we're still on a quad

216
00:06:42,160 --> 00:06:44,000
topology here and

217
00:06:44,000 --> 00:06:47,680
uh quite it should be quite good to work

218
00:06:47,680 --> 00:06:48,880
off now

219
00:06:48,880 --> 00:06:51,520
so let's shape this edge here so how am

220
00:06:51,520 --> 00:06:54,400
i doing 709

221
00:06:54,400 --> 00:06:56,800
bring that in and down a bit the whole

222
00:06:56,800 --> 00:06:57,759
edge

223
00:06:57,759 --> 00:07:02,160
to there bring this up a bit i'll wait

224
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:03,039
with that actually

225
00:07:03,039 --> 00:07:06,319
but i can select this round this off a

226
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:06,960
little bit

227
00:07:06,960 --> 00:07:10,000
to there and maybe round this off

228
00:07:10,000 --> 00:07:12,720
slightly as well so that's it and it's a

229
00:07:12,720 --> 00:07:16,000
little bit too long probably

230
00:07:16,000 --> 00:07:19,199
box selected there and a bit too high

231
00:07:19,199 --> 00:07:23,120
bring it down and to there

232
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:25,840
okay and this one we can change maybe

233
00:07:25,840 --> 00:07:26,479
well

234
00:07:26,479 --> 00:07:29,039
some shape

235
00:07:29,520 --> 00:07:33,039
rotate there all right

236
00:07:33,039 --> 00:07:35,440
all set to see that again and then now

237
00:07:35,440 --> 00:07:36,800
we can do control r

238
00:07:36,800 --> 00:07:38,240
do one more loop cut this is a nice

239
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:39,520
thing now with that finally having a

240
00:07:39,520 --> 00:07:41,039
good topology sorry for

241
00:07:41,039 --> 00:07:44,400
leading a stray for a long time but

242
00:07:44,400 --> 00:07:46,720
this should work now hopefully now we

243
00:07:46,720 --> 00:07:48,080
can just extrude this

244
00:07:48,080 --> 00:07:50,400
bonnet or hood depending on where you

245
00:07:50,400 --> 00:07:53,039
live in the world

246
00:07:53,840 --> 00:07:56,560
so i'll shift select a few of these and

247
00:07:56,560 --> 00:07:57,280
then just to

248
00:07:57,280 --> 00:07:59,280
e to extrude s to scale this one down

249
00:07:59,280 --> 00:08:01,440
let's make it a bit aggressive stylized

250
00:08:01,440 --> 00:08:04,960
again it's not gonna

251
00:08:04,960 --> 00:08:06,240
be able to see out through that window

252
00:08:06,240 --> 00:08:08,800
but that's okay looks pretty cool

253
00:08:08,800 --> 00:08:12,240
looks a bit mean okay and that's it

254
00:08:12,240 --> 00:08:12,879
let's uh

255
00:08:12,879 --> 00:08:15,680
see 548 i'm wasting time here precious

256
00:08:15,680 --> 00:08:16,160
time

257
00:08:16,160 --> 00:08:18,319
we need to put some lights on here so

258
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:19,759
let's do a headlight

259
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:24,240
in here gg to move that onto the side

260
00:08:24,240 --> 00:08:26,720
actually i'll do the whole gg there

261
00:08:26,720 --> 00:08:27,919
let's put a headlight here

262
00:08:27,919 --> 00:08:31,360
i to inset e to extrude

263
00:08:31,360 --> 00:08:34,640
and the grill e takes iten set e to

264
00:08:34,640 --> 00:08:35,279
extrude

265
00:08:35,279 --> 00:08:38,399
and down and then here make some tail

266
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:39,360
lights

267
00:08:39,360 --> 00:08:43,519
iten set e to extrude

268
00:08:43,519 --> 00:08:46,959
and i to inset and e to extrude that one

269
00:08:46,959 --> 00:08:48,080
as well and then let's

270
00:08:48,080 --> 00:08:51,200
do a number plate so to there colorize

271
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:51,920
the car a

272
00:08:51,920 --> 00:08:54,160
select everything let's make a blue

273
00:08:54,160 --> 00:08:55,360
supercar is that

274
00:08:55,360 --> 00:08:58,320
is there such a thing we can bring this

275
00:08:58,320 --> 00:08:59,920
down slightly

276
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:03,760
tweak this okay and

277
00:09:03,760 --> 00:09:07,040
gg gg slides it pretty good up these

278
00:09:07,040 --> 00:09:08,560
edges here let's put a wing on it as

279
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,160
well it's probably not very super

280
00:09:10,160 --> 00:09:11,680
like a muscle car like but i won't have

281
00:09:11,680 --> 00:09:13,360
a wing on this one so let's just do

282
00:09:13,360 --> 00:09:14,800
let's wing it

283
00:09:14,800 --> 00:09:16,880
we'll do e to extrude this whole thing

284
00:09:16,880 --> 00:09:18,720
move it back

285
00:09:18,720 --> 00:09:22,560
and then select these i to inset

286
00:09:22,560 --> 00:09:25,360
and delete to delete them faces how am i

287
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:26,160
doing 4

288
00:09:26,160 --> 00:09:29,680
35 alt shifts like this

289
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,279
and then right click on them and do

290
00:09:31,279 --> 00:09:33,120
bridge edge loops and that's going to be

291
00:09:33,120 --> 00:09:33,920
the wing

292
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,920
i think yeah okay let's colorize

293
00:09:37,920 --> 00:09:40,480
uh taillights they can be red g on the

294
00:09:40,480 --> 00:09:41,519
left side there

295
00:09:41,519 --> 00:09:44,000
ctrl plus let's make a darker blue here

296
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,360
as if it was shaded

297
00:09:45,360 --> 00:09:48,959
and then g get a white number plate

298
00:09:48,959 --> 00:09:51,200
and then headlights i guess oh what's

299
00:09:51,200 --> 00:09:52,080
happened here

300
00:09:52,080 --> 00:09:53,440
i have no idea what's happening here

301
00:09:53,440 --> 00:09:55,440
let's hide it this must have been

302
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:56,720
selected i have to fix this

303
00:09:56,720 --> 00:10:01,040
control plus delete faces

304
00:10:01,040 --> 00:10:04,079
and delete faces oh no

305
00:10:04,079 --> 00:10:07,279
delete edges then expect this

306
00:10:07,279 --> 00:10:10,000
select a few of these apparently delete

307
00:10:10,000 --> 00:10:10,800
edges

308
00:10:10,800 --> 00:10:13,839
so i've got plenty of time or something

309
00:10:13,839 --> 00:10:18,320
g let's make it dark and then here

310
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:20,880
g orange okay now we'll make some

311
00:10:20,880 --> 00:10:23,600
bumpers as well

312
00:10:25,200 --> 00:10:27,600
uh i'll select these a little bit over

313
00:10:27,600 --> 00:10:28,800
the top probably

314
00:10:28,800 --> 00:10:30,880
stylized as well alt e to extrude long

315
00:10:30,880 --> 00:10:32,160
phase normals s

316
00:10:32,160 --> 00:10:34,959
scale and bring them forward a bit ctrl

317
00:10:34,959 --> 00:10:35,440
plus

318
00:10:35,440 --> 00:10:38,399
let's make them like a black color or

319
00:10:38,399 --> 00:10:39,279
something

320
00:10:39,279 --> 00:10:42,320
here as well how am i doing 320

321
00:10:42,320 --> 00:10:46,560
ulti extra long face normals moving back

322
00:10:46,560 --> 00:10:49,920
control plus do that one a bit very dark

323
00:10:49,920 --> 00:10:53,680
lucky thing as well okay now color

324
00:10:53,680 --> 00:10:55,600
and uh we'll do the wheel arches here

325
00:10:55,600 --> 00:10:57,040
the real wheel arches

326
00:10:57,040 --> 00:11:01,040
wheel real wheel wheels on wheels

327
00:11:01,040 --> 00:11:03,440
real wheel spare wheels i don't know

328
00:11:03,440 --> 00:11:05,040
what i'm talking about

329
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,519
what's going on okay i'm shift selecting

330
00:11:07,519 --> 00:11:08,240
a view of these

331
00:11:08,240 --> 00:11:09,760
and i should have just done a different

332
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,760
method but that's okay g to move that on

333
00:11:11,760 --> 00:11:13,040
to there

334
00:11:13,040 --> 00:11:15,040
and then oh we need maybe to make

335
00:11:15,040 --> 00:11:16,480
something that looks a little bit like

336
00:11:16,480 --> 00:11:18,640
windows as well not like windows 10 or

337
00:11:18,640 --> 00:11:20,079
anything but

338
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:23,680
like car windows

339
00:11:24,560 --> 00:11:28,320
and i should probably bring gg slider

340
00:11:28,320 --> 00:11:30,959
as well let's try to color it just see

341
00:11:30,959 --> 00:11:32,079
if it works

342
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:33,920
so it could be refined a little bit

343
00:11:33,920 --> 00:11:35,839
probably

344
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:40,720
g let's make black windows gg

345
00:11:41,200 --> 00:11:44,160
and gg okay this could have probably

346
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:44,880
been

347
00:11:44,880 --> 00:11:48,320
perhaps a little bit better let's make

348
00:11:49,519 --> 00:11:53,680
oh make it blue again okay

349
00:11:54,079 --> 00:11:55,920
uh maybe not the best rear window there

350
00:11:55,920 --> 00:11:57,200
but i've got two minutes to go and i

351
00:11:57,200 --> 00:11:58,560
need to put some wheels on so

352
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,000
let's go side view shift right click

353
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:05,120
shift a cylinder and

354
00:12:05,120 --> 00:12:09,040
let's do 12 scale zed

355
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:13,040
and let's do uh

356
00:12:14,000 --> 00:12:15,680
i have to disable clipping i think move

357
00:12:15,680 --> 00:12:17,200
them into there

358
00:12:17,200 --> 00:12:20,480
rotate y 90 side view

359
00:12:20,480 --> 00:12:24,240
scale them down to there rotate

360
00:12:24,240 --> 00:12:27,519
move them up again a scale 0 on the left

361
00:12:27,519 --> 00:12:30,720
and g to move it to black move it out to

362
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:31,120
there

363
00:12:31,120 --> 00:12:33,680
we can fix this in a second 128 so

364
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:34,480
select that one

365
00:12:34,480 --> 00:12:37,600
i to inset a to extrude let's do simple

366
00:12:37,600 --> 00:12:38,320
wheels here

367
00:12:38,320 --> 00:12:42,639
i to inset e to extrude s to scale

368
00:12:42,639 --> 00:12:45,519
control plus a few times to there let's

369
00:12:45,519 --> 00:12:46,000
come

370
00:12:46,000 --> 00:12:49,040
like a gray like alloy

371
00:12:49,040 --> 00:12:51,920
rims shift select these g to move to

372
00:12:51,920 --> 00:12:52,959
black so it looks like

373
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:56,560
shadow and

374
00:12:56,560 --> 00:12:58,480
move them out we can fix the wheel arch

375
00:12:58,480 --> 00:12:59,760
just now a little bit overly aggressive

376
00:12:59,760 --> 00:13:00,240
here so

377
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:03,680
l shift d move it to there

378
00:13:03,680 --> 00:13:06,079
how am i doing 56 seconds okay here's

379
00:13:06,079 --> 00:13:07,680
the nice thing now with the wheel arches

380
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:08,800
we can

381
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,959
uh select these if i hit them

382
00:13:12,959 --> 00:13:16,160
i'll just shift select this control

383
00:13:16,160 --> 00:13:18,720
i actually just do control r of course

384
00:13:18,720 --> 00:13:21,200
and then move this in

385
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,920
and s to scale a little bit and then

386
00:13:23,920 --> 00:13:24,320
here

387
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:27,920
same thing ctrl r scale them

388
00:13:27,920 --> 00:13:30,160
and move them into there

389
00:13:30,160 --> 00:13:31,680
[Music]

390
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:34,480
and we can do i've got 28 seconds here

391
00:13:34,480 --> 00:13:35,279
maybe i can

392
00:13:35,279 --> 00:13:39,839
get the rear view mirror gg

393
00:13:39,839 --> 00:13:43,120
e to extrude r to rotate g to move

394
00:13:43,120 --> 00:13:46,240
front okay this looks really weird so

395
00:13:46,240 --> 00:13:49,839
alt said

396
00:13:51,120 --> 00:13:53,440
we can fix we can stylize a little bit

397
00:13:53,440 --> 00:13:54,160
later on

398
00:13:54,160 --> 00:13:58,000
so here rotate

399
00:13:58,000 --> 00:14:00,240
it extrude r to rotate one second e

400
00:14:00,240 --> 00:14:01,120
takes red

401
00:14:01,120 --> 00:14:03,270
that's the scale i rotate that

402
00:14:03,270 --> 00:14:06,309
[Music]

403
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,380
okay so let's see what we got

404
00:14:08,380 --> 00:14:10,880
[Music]

405
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,800
so pardon the shape of the car that

406
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,560
didn't turn out that all that great

407
00:14:14,560 --> 00:14:16,800
but i think the topology is really good

408
00:14:16,800 --> 00:14:18,240
and i guess uh it's pretty good that it

409
00:14:18,240 --> 00:14:18,720
ended up

410
00:14:18,720 --> 00:14:20,320
this uh not so good because now we can

411
00:14:20,320 --> 00:14:21,519
actually play a little bit in the bonus

412
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:22,639
material and

413
00:14:22,639 --> 00:14:25,120
show why this topology is pretty good uh

414
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:26,639
there are a few things that we could fix

415
00:14:26,639 --> 00:14:28,560
with it um there's a few things down

416
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,160
here that i did when i scaled it we can

417
00:14:30,160 --> 00:14:30,480
do

418
00:14:30,480 --> 00:14:33,040
the whole shape is a little bit odd

419
00:14:33,040 --> 00:14:33,920
which we can fix

420
00:14:33,920 --> 00:14:37,199
all of this now so here comes the bonus

421
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,720
tips now and i think yeah this is why

422
00:14:38,720 --> 00:14:40,480
you should stay to the end and not just

423
00:14:40,480 --> 00:14:42,079
switch off now really stay to the end

424
00:14:42,079 --> 00:14:44,000
and watch this bit because

425
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:45,519
if you have this shape and you wanted to

426
00:14:45,519 --> 00:14:47,360
start to refine this either into a make

427
00:14:47,360 --> 00:14:48,560
it let's say you wanted to change the

428
00:14:48,560 --> 00:14:50,480
front here we could uh

429
00:14:50,480 --> 00:14:53,040
let's see if i do proportional editing

430
00:14:53,040 --> 00:14:54,000
and make sure

431
00:14:54,000 --> 00:14:56,000
connected only is on so we don't want to

432
00:14:56,000 --> 00:14:58,480
scale the wheels now and then

433
00:14:58,480 --> 00:15:01,519
i can do scale z and then

434
00:15:01,519 --> 00:15:03,600
scale that up maybe use the mouse wheel

435
00:15:03,600 --> 00:15:05,040
to change that

436
00:15:05,040 --> 00:15:08,399
maybe i want to bring this down g z

437
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:11,040
scroll the mouse wheel down change it to

438
00:15:11,040 --> 00:15:13,199
there maybe

439
00:15:13,199 --> 00:15:14,800
g to move that forward even more if you

440
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
wanted it more aggressive maybe we

441
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:17,680
wanted to change this whole thing

442
00:15:17,680 --> 00:15:20,240
a little bit so maybe it's too long so

443
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,519
alt z

444
00:15:21,519 --> 00:15:25,680
one select these

445
00:15:25,680 --> 00:15:29,199
move it in maybe here

446
00:15:29,199 --> 00:15:32,639
move that in make it shorter

447
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:34,480
back is way too long here as well so

448
00:15:34,480 --> 00:15:37,440
let's do control

449
00:15:37,519 --> 00:15:40,560
move it to there move this in

450
00:15:40,560 --> 00:15:43,440
move that to there

451
00:15:44,079 --> 00:15:46,240
and then alt side again here let's say

452
00:15:46,240 --> 00:15:47,360
we wanted to

453
00:15:47,360 --> 00:15:48,959
make this rear view mirror actually look

454
00:15:48,959 --> 00:15:51,040
a little bit nicer we could do

455
00:15:51,040 --> 00:15:56,000
e to extrude has s scale that one down

456
00:15:56,000 --> 00:15:59,600
maybe we'll bring these back and

457
00:15:59,600 --> 00:16:02,399
the bottom here

458
00:16:05,199 --> 00:16:08,639
to there colorize this black g

459
00:16:08,639 --> 00:16:10,880
black

460
00:16:13,680 --> 00:16:17,120
move that down to there maybe oh that's

461
00:16:17,120 --> 00:16:19,680
with too much

462
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,839
g

463
00:16:24,000 --> 00:16:25,839
okay and here the wheel arches as well

464
00:16:25,839 --> 00:16:27,759
here's uh i think this is probably the

465
00:16:27,759 --> 00:16:28,560
most important

466
00:16:28,560 --> 00:16:30,399
part that i'm most happy with the whole

467
00:16:30,399 --> 00:16:32,000
build as well it's uh the fact that

468
00:16:32,000 --> 00:16:33,920
these wheel arches now can be really

469
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:34,399
just

470
00:16:34,399 --> 00:16:35,920
selected like this usually i ended up

471
00:16:35,920 --> 00:16:39,759
with really weird edges right here

472
00:16:39,759 --> 00:16:41,839
so but now s to scale if you want to

473
00:16:41,839 --> 00:16:43,360
make more room for the wheels you could

474
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,360
do o for proportional again as to scale

475
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,680
down

476
00:16:47,680 --> 00:16:50,720
has to scale it move it up if you want

477
00:16:50,720 --> 00:16:52,399
to do that

478
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,639
and same here in the back if i do select

479
00:16:54,639 --> 00:16:55,680
this one

480
00:16:55,680 --> 00:16:58,720
ctrl select to here all the way down to

481
00:16:58,720 --> 00:17:03,040
there let's do scale on this one

482
00:17:03,279 --> 00:17:06,559
move that in maybe

483
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:11,199
and if you want to bring this in

484
00:17:11,199 --> 00:17:14,559
let's select these move oh proportional

485
00:17:14,559 --> 00:17:15,439
off now baby

486
00:17:15,439 --> 00:17:17,280
bring those in get this whole thing

487
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,400
flaring out a little bit more

488
00:17:22,319 --> 00:17:24,079
and if you wanted to change here i

489
00:17:24,079 --> 00:17:25,439
noticed that the bonnet was a little bit

490
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,119
too started too far

491
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:30,160
so let's just slide that back maybe we

492
00:17:30,160 --> 00:17:31,360
can do either

493
00:17:31,360 --> 00:17:34,960
so it goes like this we can bring

494
00:17:34,960 --> 00:17:37,600
this down

495
00:17:38,320 --> 00:17:46,799
g g

496
00:17:46,799 --> 00:17:51,039
bring this up out

497
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:52,799
and if you want to change the look of

498
00:17:52,799 --> 00:17:54,480
the headlights maybe you want this

499
00:17:54,480 --> 00:17:59,039
to be more like a teardrop so front view

500
00:17:59,039 --> 00:18:02,640
o proportional g move that

501
00:18:02,640 --> 00:18:07,039
to maybe like this

502
00:18:07,039 --> 00:18:14,160
s to scale it g to move it

503
00:18:14,160 --> 00:18:17,440
and then we'll bring this down as well

504
00:18:17,440 --> 00:18:19,919
to there

505
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,559
we could control select the whole front

506
00:18:22,559 --> 00:18:24,559
there maybe drag it forward

507
00:18:24,559 --> 00:18:27,520
a little bit pointy nose also a bit over

508
00:18:27,520 --> 00:18:28,400
the top maybe

509
00:18:28,400 --> 00:18:30,000
i like the film with sylvester stallone

510
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:31,760
over the top

511
00:18:31,760 --> 00:18:33,520
cow's a dog a weird film just out of the

512
00:18:33,520 --> 00:18:35,120
blue everyone was so

513
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:36,960
hyped on rambo and rocky and stuff that

514
00:18:36,960 --> 00:18:38,160
they pretty much binged

515
00:18:38,160 --> 00:18:40,080
anything that sylvester stallone pulled

516
00:18:40,080 --> 00:18:43,120
out of his

517
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:48,640
repertoire so maybe something like that

518
00:18:49,600 --> 00:18:51,760
okay oh yeah i wanted to show this as

519
00:18:51,760 --> 00:18:53,360
well i managed to

520
00:18:53,360 --> 00:18:56,480
mess up a little bit here you can if you

521
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,080
wanted to space these out you could do

522
00:18:58,080 --> 00:18:58,720
gg

523
00:18:58,720 --> 00:19:01,280
just move them apart a little bit here

524
00:19:01,280 --> 00:19:01,919
gg

525
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:06,000
to keep the quad gg

526
00:19:06,000 --> 00:19:11,039
gg that's it

527
00:19:11,039 --> 00:19:13,600
and you could work on uh fixing the rear

528
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:15,440
window that was a bit strange maybe we

529
00:19:15,440 --> 00:19:16,240
can

530
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:20,799
move that forward a bit down

531
00:19:20,799 --> 00:19:22,880
so i'm not a car designer by the way so

532
00:19:22,880 --> 00:19:24,240
sorry for this

533
00:19:24,240 --> 00:19:25,600
i should have probably used some sort of

534
00:19:25,600 --> 00:19:27,600
a blueprint the good thing about the 10

535
00:19:27,600 --> 00:19:28,720
minute modeling challenge is

536
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,559
that i can just blame it on the time

537
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:33,039
frame so

538
00:19:33,039 --> 00:19:34,160
and if you wanted to make the whole

539
00:19:34,160 --> 00:19:36,000
thing wider a select everything just

540
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:36,960
move it wider

541
00:19:36,960 --> 00:19:38,880
that's it or it controls that if you

542
00:19:38,880 --> 00:19:40,320
didn't want to make it wider

543
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:42,080
if you really want to go crazy you can

544
00:19:42,080 --> 00:19:43,600
actually do that as well and

545
00:19:43,600 --> 00:19:46,400
uh check this out let's say we wanted to

546
00:19:46,400 --> 00:19:47,120
make a

547
00:19:47,120 --> 00:19:49,039
like a fun looking car not that this

548
00:19:49,039 --> 00:19:50,640
isn't fun looking this is looking dodgy

549
00:19:50,640 --> 00:19:51,280
already

550
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:53,679
but let's go back with proportional now

551
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,039
let's go crazy

552
00:19:55,039 --> 00:19:58,480
let's do g to move this one scroll it up

553
00:19:58,480 --> 00:20:01,200
let's lean that one forward let's pick

554
00:20:01,200 --> 00:20:02,080
that one

555
00:20:02,080 --> 00:20:04,880
g to move that on scroll it up sometimes

556
00:20:04,880 --> 00:20:06,960
i've seen these like cartoony

557
00:20:06,960 --> 00:20:09,919
uh looking cars so i wanted to try to

558
00:20:09,919 --> 00:20:11,600
make something a little bit similar

559
00:20:11,600 --> 00:20:15,919
r to rotate g to move that on

560
00:20:16,159 --> 00:20:17,919
let's go even crazier with the front

561
00:20:17,919 --> 00:20:21,679
here g

562
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,960
r to rotate g

563
00:20:24,960 --> 00:20:29,200
that's this looks a bit strange maybe

564
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,600
move that one let's do this whole thing

565
00:20:31,600 --> 00:20:33,280
g to move this

566
00:20:33,280 --> 00:20:35,840
wheel that up let's make it a lot wider

567
00:20:35,840 --> 00:20:38,080
here

568
00:20:40,480 --> 00:20:44,000
let's select control selected there

569
00:20:44,000 --> 00:20:49,120
g x

570
00:20:49,120 --> 00:20:54,080
control selector there gx

571
00:20:54,320 --> 00:21:02,000
and now you can even r to rotate

572
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:06,640
do the same here ctrl selected to there

573
00:21:06,640 --> 00:21:09,600
or to rotate and then we have to do the

574
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,799
same with the wheels then

575
00:21:10,799 --> 00:21:15,039
so has to scale them up

576
00:21:15,039 --> 00:21:16,720
and i think when i see these funny

577
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,720
pictures of these they even do the crazy

578
00:21:18,720 --> 00:21:20,159
stuff when they draw them like with the

579
00:21:20,159 --> 00:21:20,640
wheels

580
00:21:20,640 --> 00:21:24,720
so let's bring g x

581
00:21:24,960 --> 00:21:28,400
and then here let's do the same thing

582
00:21:28,400 --> 00:21:28,880
here

583
00:21:28,880 --> 00:21:32,000
l scale that up g

584
00:21:32,000 --> 00:21:36,240
pick the bottom g x

585
00:21:37,360 --> 00:21:39,440
and here we can just g to move this

586
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:44,559
whole thing to make it fit

587
00:21:44,559 --> 00:21:47,440
like that and i understand if you don't

588
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:49,039
like this card that's perfectly fine i

589
00:21:49,039 --> 00:21:50,480
just wanted to make a point that you can

590
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:51,919
make them uh really

591
00:21:51,919 --> 00:21:53,760
like the cartoon stylized ones again

592
00:21:53,760 --> 00:21:55,679
with the topology now it should deform

593
00:21:55,679 --> 00:21:57,039
really nicely well

594
00:21:57,039 --> 00:21:59,600
not that this is deforming that nicely

595
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:00,480
but

596
00:22:00,480 --> 00:22:01,840
you get the point i think that you could

597
00:22:01,840 --> 00:22:05,360
make these uh funky looking cars

598
00:22:05,360 --> 00:22:08,400
and maybe we'll do a over the top here

599
00:22:08,400 --> 00:22:09,440
with a

600
00:22:09,440 --> 00:22:12,640
bonnet or the hood let's do one of those

601
00:22:12,640 --> 00:22:15,760
intakes here as well

602
00:22:15,760 --> 00:22:18,640
e to extrude

603
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,559
bring this in

604
00:22:23,600 --> 00:22:27,440
and bring that up even more

605
00:22:27,440 --> 00:22:31,840
g is that oh no g y

606
00:22:32,080 --> 00:22:35,600
and g is that that's what i want

607
00:22:35,600 --> 00:22:41,840
i to inset e to extrude

608
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:52,559
g okay g

609
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:55,840
proportional

610
00:22:58,080 --> 00:23:00,400
all right

611
00:23:03,840 --> 00:23:07,919
shift selector there rotate

612
00:23:12,159 --> 00:23:13,840
i've always thought that box modeling

613
00:23:13,840 --> 00:23:15,360
didn't really allow you to create a good

614
00:23:15,360 --> 00:23:17,200
car and i've even seen tutorials from

615
00:23:17,200 --> 00:23:19,280
some established people to say that

616
00:23:19,280 --> 00:23:21,840
don't start from a box start from from

617
00:23:21,840 --> 00:23:22,799
splines instead

618
00:23:22,799 --> 00:23:24,640
but the two key things here that i think

619
00:23:24,640 --> 00:23:26,000
really makes this work is

620
00:23:26,000 --> 00:23:27,600
when you do the wheel arches that you do

621
00:23:27,600 --> 00:23:30,080
the inset with the boundary off

622
00:23:30,080 --> 00:23:32,159
and also when you extrude the top of the

623
00:23:32,159 --> 00:23:34,320
car but you also do an inset and then

624
00:23:34,320 --> 00:23:36,240
you extrude that inset that's going to

625
00:23:36,240 --> 00:23:37,919
be the key takeaway from this video that

626
00:23:37,919 --> 00:23:38,640
you can make

627
00:23:38,640 --> 00:23:41,279
car topology from box modeling and you

628
00:23:41,279 --> 00:23:42,799
can get it pretty good as well and

629
00:23:42,799 --> 00:23:44,480
you can keep those quad going you don't

630
00:23:44,480 --> 00:23:45,919
really have to compromise on them

631
00:23:45,919 --> 00:23:46,720
anywhere

632
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,480
and you'll always be able to do the loop

633
00:23:48,480 --> 00:23:50,559
cuts it'll always deform nicely

634
00:23:50,559 --> 00:23:52,080
i'm really really happy that i found

635
00:23:52,080 --> 00:23:53,840
this method now because i've it's been a

636
00:23:53,840 --> 00:23:55,440
bit it's probably going to be the

637
00:23:55,440 --> 00:23:57,600
holy grail for me when it comes to

638
00:23:57,600 --> 00:23:59,039
modeling because i always like to start

639
00:23:59,039 --> 00:24:00,799
with a box i don't really like the

640
00:24:00,799 --> 00:24:03,120
spline modeling where you outline them

641
00:24:03,120 --> 00:24:04,080
and i'm really really

642
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:06,320
happy that this box method now works and

643
00:24:06,320 --> 00:24:08,799
i'm super excited about the wheel arches

644
00:24:08,799 --> 00:24:10,640
because the loop cuts now will allow you

645
00:24:10,640 --> 00:24:12,720
to keep those arches coming out

646
00:24:12,720 --> 00:24:14,799
and always when i've done trying to keep

647
00:24:14,799 --> 00:24:16,799
the quads when i do spine modeling i

648
00:24:16,799 --> 00:24:18,080
always end up messing it up

649
00:24:18,080 --> 00:24:20,320
around those arches so i hope you

650
00:24:20,320 --> 00:24:21,840
managed to take some stuff away from

651
00:24:21,840 --> 00:24:23,360
this as well and i think i'm gonna do a

652
00:24:23,360 --> 00:24:25,520
proper tutorial on this topic as well

653
00:24:25,520 --> 00:24:27,440
maybe i don't have to stress the car to

654
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:29,520
make it look a little bit so

655
00:24:29,520 --> 00:24:31,200
so weird of a car maybe i can actually

656
00:24:31,200 --> 00:24:33,679
use a blueprint so i make some real cars

657
00:24:33,679 --> 00:24:35,840
how about that i'm going to upload this

658
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:38,000
to my patreon page so anyone on the

659
00:24:38,000 --> 00:24:38,960
tutorial tier

660
00:24:38,960 --> 00:24:40,880
which is two dollars at the moment

661
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,400
anyone on that tier will be able to
