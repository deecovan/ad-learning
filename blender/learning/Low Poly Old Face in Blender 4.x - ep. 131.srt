00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:02,000
hello everyone and welcome to episode

2
00:00:02,000 --> 00:00:04,480
131 of the 10-minute Ming challenge

3
00:00:04,480 --> 00:00:06,279
today I'm going to be doing a low poly

4
00:00:06,279 --> 00:00:08,240
face and I've been doing low poly

5
00:00:08,240 --> 00:00:10,240
characters for a long time usually I

6
00:00:10,240 --> 00:00:13,040
just kind of keep a simple head and two

7
00:00:13,040 --> 00:00:15,240
dots for eyes and I really wanted to try

8
00:00:15,240 --> 00:00:17,000
to add a few like a little bit more

9
00:00:17,000 --> 00:00:19,160
definition to my low poly phases now and

10
00:00:19,160 --> 00:00:20,840
I don't feel like I've gotten close

11
00:00:20,840 --> 00:00:22,240
enough to where I want to be yet so

12
00:00:22,240 --> 00:00:24,680
maybe today could be a practice run and

13
00:00:24,680 --> 00:00:26,640
then see if I can improve on this front

14
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,439
I'm I'm really looking for a specific

15
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:31,160
style hard to Define but I think once I

16
00:00:31,160 --> 00:00:33,840
find it I'll be happy with it but today

17
00:00:33,840 --> 00:00:35,360
I might not get there but we'll have a

18
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,079
good laugh trying at least I'm also

19
00:00:37,079 --> 00:00:39,160
going to throw some shape Keys woo in

20
00:00:39,160 --> 00:00:40,440
there as well cuz I want to have the

21
00:00:40,440 --> 00:00:42,160
character to be able to Blink and then

22
00:00:42,160 --> 00:00:44,280
just a very basic speak animation I'm

23
00:00:44,280 --> 00:00:46,079
probably just going to do like a one

24
00:00:46,079 --> 00:00:47,719
like a mouth movement and we'll see how

25
00:00:47,719 --> 00:00:49,960
we go from there so let's get started

26
00:00:49,960 --> 00:00:51,440
straight away I'm just going to model a

27
00:00:51,440 --> 00:00:53,640
low poly head and we'll see how it goes

28
00:00:53,640 --> 00:00:58,160
Ready Steady go and off yes all right so

29
00:00:58,160 --> 00:01:00,120
T into edit mode eight select everything

30
00:01:00,120 --> 00:01:01,359
first I'm going to go to edit and do

31
00:01:01,359 --> 00:01:03,920
auto mirror now tab into edit mode a

32
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,760
select everything scale it down move it

33
00:01:05,760 --> 00:01:09,000
up and go to here and then move it in as

34
00:01:09,000 --> 00:01:10,360
well and on the left side I'm going to

35
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,200
do a select everything and then just

36
00:01:12,200 --> 00:01:15,200
move my UVS down here to some sort of a

37
00:01:15,200 --> 00:01:17,920
skin tone maybe like this would be all

38
00:01:17,920 --> 00:01:20,240
right or maybe over here there we go all

39
00:01:20,240 --> 00:01:22,799
right so I think I'm going to do control

40
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,880
one here to do a subdivision modifier to

41
00:01:24,880 --> 00:01:26,240
get started and I'm going to apply this

42
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,759
one on the right here so contrl a on the

43
00:01:28,759 --> 00:01:31,280
the subdivision eight select everything

44
00:01:31,280 --> 00:01:34,880
and then just scale it maybe like this

45
00:01:34,880 --> 00:01:36,560
and this is probably looking similar to

46
00:01:36,560 --> 00:01:38,399
how I've done in the past but let's see

47
00:01:38,399 --> 00:01:40,520
if we can get it going I'm going to move

48
00:01:40,520 --> 00:01:43,600
this these edges down maybe like this to

49
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:47,159
here and uh here let's do a controlr

50
00:01:47,159 --> 00:01:51,040
subdivide and move these up and for

51
00:01:51,040 --> 00:01:53,640
let's I think I need to move these in

52
00:01:53,640 --> 00:01:55,079
all side I don't want to see through

53
00:01:55,079 --> 00:01:57,680
anymore alt shift click on that edge and

54
00:01:57,680 --> 00:01:59,960
then move it into here and then I'm

55
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:01,680
still going to move this one in I think

56
00:02:01,680 --> 00:02:04,799
that's a good like shape and control R

57
00:02:04,799 --> 00:02:07,680
move this one and then move this one

58
00:02:07,680 --> 00:02:10,599
into here so still a bit similar to

59
00:02:10,599 --> 00:02:12,480
maybe what I've done in the past but I

60
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:15,000
think once I find what I'm looking for

61
00:02:15,000 --> 00:02:16,640
I'll be happy I don't know exactly what

62
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:17,959
it is yet but I'm know that I'm not

63
00:02:17,959 --> 00:02:19,640
happy when I search for references

64
00:02:19,640 --> 00:02:21,360
online I still don't really feel that

65
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,319
I'm getting happy with the any anything

66
00:02:23,319 --> 00:02:25,160
that anyone else has created either so

67
00:02:25,160 --> 00:02:26,440
I'm just going to keep trying and see if

68
00:02:26,440 --> 00:02:28,840
I can find like a face that I like on

69
00:02:28,840 --> 00:02:30,640
this one I usually never noses but I'm

70
00:02:30,640 --> 00:02:31,840
going to do a nose now so I'm going to

71
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,440
go control R cuz I need a little bit

72
00:02:34,440 --> 00:02:36,920
more like lines here anyway and here

73
00:02:36,920 --> 00:02:40,040
I'll just grab these and E to extrude

74
00:02:40,040 --> 00:02:41,760
and here is going to be our hideous nose

75
00:02:41,760 --> 00:02:43,200
it looks horrible at the moment I know

76
00:02:43,200 --> 00:02:46,560
bear with me GG and GG to slide this one

77
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:48,959
down G to slide I think I'm going to

78
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,800
have to go into overtime again today cuz

79
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:52,680
in 10 minutes I'm not going to be happy

80
00:02:52,680 --> 00:02:54,599
with the result so we'll see if I can

81
00:02:54,599 --> 00:02:56,560
just edit my way out of it whatever it

82
00:02:56,560 --> 00:02:59,360
is proportional o on the hot key there

83
00:02:59,360 --> 00:03:01,000
so I'm going to select all of these and

84
00:03:01,000 --> 00:03:04,000
G to move that on and there's our face

85
00:03:04,000 --> 00:03:05,840
this is looking a little bit wonky so

86
00:03:05,840 --> 00:03:07,799
maybe okay oh cuz I want to do

87
00:03:07,799 --> 00:03:09,959
proportional off now and then we're

88
00:03:09,959 --> 00:03:12,480
going to get the nose in G and how am I

89
00:03:12,480 --> 00:03:16,760
doing 744 so uh not the airplane that'

90
00:03:16,760 --> 00:03:18,920
be too big I think G to move that one

91
00:03:18,920 --> 00:03:20,879
down and I'm going to do like a an old

92
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:24,040
man with a beard white hair and stuff

93
00:03:24,040 --> 00:03:26,519
and I think I need U some sort of a

94
00:03:26,519 --> 00:03:27,959
here's uh where I think I want to do it

95
00:03:27,959 --> 00:03:30,080
a little bit different uh I want to do

96
00:03:30,080 --> 00:03:33,159
like a shape like this to get and then

97
00:03:33,159 --> 00:03:35,200
I'm going to do eyes here and it's too

98
00:03:35,200 --> 00:03:37,560
wide too round so Al said this is what

99
00:03:37,560 --> 00:03:40,560
is driving me nuts a little bit scale x

100
00:03:40,560 --> 00:03:43,480
g to move that in scale X cuz I'm going

101
00:03:43,480 --> 00:03:47,360
to try okay big forehead so not saying

102
00:03:47,360 --> 00:03:50,200
anything not saying anything uh there we

103
00:03:50,200 --> 00:03:52,519
go all set to see through again and G

104
00:03:52,519 --> 00:03:54,159
and here I'm going to do a mouth now so

105
00:03:54,159 --> 00:03:56,239
control R I'll actually I'm do you know

106
00:03:56,239 --> 00:03:58,200
what I'm going to do I'm going to cut it

107
00:03:58,200 --> 00:04:00,640
so K knife to and then I'm going to

108
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:03,680
create a mouth like this just as simple

109
00:04:03,680 --> 00:04:04,959
cuz I'm going to be able to shape this

110
00:04:04,959 --> 00:04:06,640
one later on and I've broken the

111
00:04:06,640 --> 00:04:08,360
topology now so I'm just going to fix

112
00:04:08,360 --> 00:04:10,959
the topology so instead of doing that I

113
00:04:10,959 --> 00:04:12,680
actually have to do this k for knife

114
00:04:12,680 --> 00:04:15,760
tool if as long as I do like this I can

115
00:04:15,760 --> 00:04:17,600
introduce a quad topology again cuz this

116
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,919
one I might want to subdivide in the

117
00:04:18,919 --> 00:04:21,479
future so J to connect that on and J to

118
00:04:21,479 --> 00:04:23,360
connect that and I think I'm going to go

119
00:04:23,360 --> 00:04:25,600
control R and I'm still on a quad

120
00:04:25,600 --> 00:04:29,000
topology here this is looking very but

121
00:04:29,000 --> 00:04:31,440
it's okay I'm I'm okay with it uh g g

122
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,759
cuz I'm going to put some beard here to

123
00:04:32,759 --> 00:04:35,320
cover this stuff we'll see how it goes

124
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:39,320
and G move there and usually I do like I

125
00:04:39,320 --> 00:04:41,320
don't do enough definition on my faces I

126
00:04:41,320 --> 00:04:43,080
think that's why they tend to look a

127
00:04:43,080 --> 00:04:44,800
little bit I don't know cartoony and

128
00:04:44,800 --> 00:04:46,919
boring so now I'm going to start by

129
00:04:46,919 --> 00:04:48,680
first of all I'm going to okay this is

130
00:04:48,680 --> 00:04:50,880
might have an issue here with the think

131
00:04:50,880 --> 00:04:52,360
I'm going to do control R here as well

132
00:04:52,360 --> 00:04:54,160
so I can get a little bit more shape

133
00:04:54,160 --> 00:05:00,039
there GG and gg gg gg and GG slide it

134
00:05:00,039 --> 00:05:03,039
like if you do double G there and like

135
00:05:03,039 --> 00:05:05,199
this I'll do all right that's going to

136
00:05:05,199 --> 00:05:07,759
do how am I doing 550 on the clock so

137
00:05:07,759 --> 00:05:10,000
now I'm going to probably just put uh

138
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,360
I'm going to colorize a little bit to

139
00:05:11,360 --> 00:05:14,080
get um some like darker that's I

140
00:05:14,080 --> 00:05:15,360
probably don't colorize it enough I'm

141
00:05:15,360 --> 00:05:17,000
going to actually going to shift the Hue

142
00:05:17,000 --> 00:05:19,919
as well all the way to over here and on

143
00:05:19,919 --> 00:05:22,000
the lips here I'm just going to do like

144
00:05:22,000 --> 00:05:24,280
a really dark color there as well this

145
00:05:24,280 --> 00:05:26,319
looks stupid so the mouth is going to be

146
00:05:26,319 --> 00:05:28,759
smaller I've this just decided a lot

147
00:05:28,759 --> 00:05:32,440
smaller cuz it just want a little like

148
00:05:32,440 --> 00:05:34,560
okay this is still too big so I want to

149
00:05:34,560 --> 00:05:36,520
do shift select these

150
00:05:36,520 --> 00:05:38,840
G G and you're not going to see too much

151
00:05:38,840 --> 00:05:40,120
in the mouth cuz I'm going to be putting

152
00:05:40,120 --> 00:05:42,319
a beard here so we might have to do the

153
00:05:42,319 --> 00:05:44,440
fail check today cuz I'm not quite sure

154
00:05:44,440 --> 00:05:47,000
I'll be able to finish this on time we

155
00:05:47,000 --> 00:05:49,840
shall find out we shall find out for

156
00:05:49,840 --> 00:05:52,600
sure G to move that on and I think I'm

157
00:05:52,600 --> 00:05:56,039
going to do uh let's just do like this

158
00:05:56,039 --> 00:05:59,319
I'm going to put eyebrows so and start

159
00:05:59,319 --> 00:06:01,199
to do do with the hairs cuz I need to

160
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:04,039
I'm running out of time scale y z and

161
00:06:04,039 --> 00:06:07,680
scale Z move it down G to move it in and

162
00:06:07,680 --> 00:06:09,560
e to extrude it now I'm going to put low

163
00:06:09,560 --> 00:06:11,120
poly eyebrows cuz I'm going to just

164
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:12,639
animate these later on so I'm just going

165
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,680
to put them to be like white as well cuz

166
00:06:14,680 --> 00:06:17,160
this going to be like bit old cuz I need

167
00:06:17,160 --> 00:06:21,680
like um a wise man or something in like

168
00:06:21,680 --> 00:06:23,919
I can just see it need needs have a lot

169
00:06:23,919 --> 00:06:27,759
of white so old yeah whatever Shifty to

170
00:06:27,759 --> 00:06:29,319
duplicate this one and I'm going to do

171
00:06:29,319 --> 00:06:30,919
like eyes here and I'm already hating

172
00:06:30,919 --> 00:06:33,000
what I'm seeing but it's okay uh it's

173
00:06:33,000 --> 00:06:34,520
okay I think I've had that tip in the

174
00:06:34,520 --> 00:06:36,240
past that you it's okay for things to

175
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:38,319
look super bad as long you can always

176
00:06:38,319 --> 00:06:40,720
delete it at some point famous words

177
00:06:40,720 --> 00:06:45,360
scale uh Zed G just going to do some

178
00:06:45,360 --> 00:06:48,599
carony style eyes eyes here so G to move

179
00:06:48,599 --> 00:06:52,319
the in El select the link g z just go

180
00:06:52,319 --> 00:06:54,520
for a dark gray there and then scale

181
00:06:54,520 --> 00:06:57,319
these down rotate G now I'm just going

182
00:06:57,319 --> 00:06:59,639
to start refining a bit and hopefully

183
00:06:59,639 --> 00:07:01,280
this will come to some sort of a it'll

184
00:07:01,280 --> 00:07:04,319
make sense in the end don't don't uh say

185
00:07:04,319 --> 00:07:05,759
anything in the chat if you're watching

186
00:07:05,759 --> 00:07:07,680
the premiere I know this is looking very

187
00:07:07,680 --> 00:07:10,160
bad at the moment it definitely needs uh

188
00:07:10,160 --> 00:07:12,360
some hair now and I don't know if I can

189
00:07:12,360 --> 00:07:14,680
rescue this thing I think I've already

190
00:07:14,680 --> 00:07:16,400
uh I see the fail chick already starting

191
00:07:16,400 --> 00:07:19,440
to come out but we'll see I think I also

192
00:07:19,440 --> 00:07:21,919
want to bring these in it's I think this

193
00:07:21,919 --> 00:07:23,120
is the thing with when it comes to

194
00:07:23,120 --> 00:07:24,720
phases I don't have any reference to go

195
00:07:24,720 --> 00:07:27,759
now so I'm going to I think I'm going to

196
00:07:27,759 --> 00:07:30,000
just keep tweaking I think the ver until

197
00:07:30,000 --> 00:07:33,440
I I feel like something is making sense

198
00:07:33,440 --> 00:07:35,840
and I think that's going to be all right

199
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:39,039
for now rotate G and then now I'm going

200
00:07:39,039 --> 00:07:40,639
to put hair on it cuz I hate what I'm

201
00:07:40,639 --> 00:07:43,360
seeing right now this is so bad actually

202
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:44,879
this is probably the worst head I've

203
00:07:44,879 --> 00:07:48,440
ever done uh but it's okay it's okay and

204
00:07:48,440 --> 00:07:51,479
I'm going to do ears here as well so gg

205
00:07:51,479 --> 00:07:54,400
gg and then GG and here I'm just going

206
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:57,280
to I guess I'm just going to inser this

207
00:07:57,280 --> 00:08:01,759
uh scale Zed G I think the had I did

208
00:08:01,759 --> 00:08:03,039
last time was better this is why I need

209
00:08:03,039 --> 00:08:07,319
the practice you see so I to inset scale

210
00:08:07,319 --> 00:08:12,000
y okay o proportional off scale Y and

211
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:14,680
then uh I'm just going to let's let's

212
00:08:14,680 --> 00:08:17,759
see uh will I be able to salvage this

213
00:08:17,759 --> 00:08:19,159
I'm actually getting nervous now as well

214
00:08:19,159 --> 00:08:21,479
cuz this might you see I feel like

215
00:08:21,479 --> 00:08:23,080
imposter syndromes every now and then

216
00:08:23,080 --> 00:08:26,599
and this is the reason why like I don't

217
00:08:26,599 --> 00:08:28,120
deserve to have a reputation of being a

218
00:08:28,120 --> 00:08:30,520
low poly model and this is what I'm

219
00:08:30,520 --> 00:08:33,719
creating so all said say let's see if I

220
00:08:33,719 --> 00:08:36,560
can bring this in a little bit G all

221
00:08:36,560 --> 00:08:38,399
right and now I'm going to have to put

222
00:08:38,399 --> 00:08:40,240
the hair on cuz I need to get oh two two

223
00:08:40,240 --> 00:08:42,479
minutes to go okay all said so I'm just

224
00:08:42,479 --> 00:08:44,159
going to do like I'll just grab the top

225
00:08:44,159 --> 00:08:46,839
faces here Shifty to duplicate this SK

226
00:08:46,839 --> 00:08:50,600
like scale it like that e to extrude it

227
00:08:50,600 --> 00:08:53,920
and then uh we'll just do I don't know

228
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:57,000
uh shift select these I just need to

229
00:08:57,000 --> 00:08:58,880
cover the mouth cuz it's so hideous that

230
00:08:58,880 --> 00:09:01,000
I really need to cover it before the

231
00:09:01,000 --> 00:09:02,959
time rounds out and that if if I manage

232
00:09:02,959 --> 00:09:04,640
to do that I'll be

233
00:09:04,640 --> 00:09:09,560
happy uh and then I'll just do scale and

234
00:09:09,560 --> 00:09:11,279
E to

235
00:09:11,279 --> 00:09:14,600
extrude okay I missed the face here I

236
00:09:14,600 --> 00:09:19,000
missed like the whole face G scale scale

237
00:09:19,000 --> 00:09:22,040
Zed G all right I need

238
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,920
to I feel uh Panic set me you

239
00:09:25,920 --> 00:09:28,240
know all right I need a beard I need a

240
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:30,320
beard I need a beard this to like to fix

241
00:09:30,320 --> 00:09:32,560
this thing shift e to duplicate that on

242
00:09:32,560 --> 00:09:34,959
E to extrude all right I've got one

243
00:09:34,959 --> 00:09:37,440
minute to like just cover this mess up L

244
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:40,880
to select the link R to rotate G to move

245
00:09:40,880 --> 00:09:43,480
and E to extrude R to rotate e to

246
00:09:43,480 --> 00:09:45,720
extrude R to rotate and then I'm just

247
00:09:45,720 --> 00:09:47,440
going to e to extrude this one down and

248
00:09:47,440 --> 00:09:49,000
then I'm going to e to extrude this one

249
00:09:49,000 --> 00:09:52,200
in and E to extrude again and then here

250
00:09:52,200 --> 00:09:54,200
I'm just I'm going to have to definitely

251
00:09:54,200 --> 00:09:55,800
tweak a lot of stuff here but it's all

252
00:09:55,800 --> 00:09:58,920
right e to extrude rotate Zed g e to

253
00:09:58,920 --> 00:10:00,160
extrude

254
00:10:00,160 --> 00:10:02,640
rotate oh whoa whoa who whoa whoa what's

255
00:10:02,640 --> 00:10:04,240
going on here it's got some serious

256
00:10:04,240 --> 00:10:07,120
issues and then here I'll should I link

257
00:10:07,120 --> 00:10:10,680
these together and rotate 47 second okay

258
00:10:10,680 --> 00:10:12,600
let's just color this white anyway

259
00:10:12,600 --> 00:10:14,160
that's a step in the right direction

260
00:10:14,160 --> 00:10:15,959
there we go and then I need to do

261
00:10:15,959 --> 00:10:18,560
something with our here so I'm going to

262
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:23,680
g e g whatever what what am I doing here

263
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:28,040
g g e to extrude this one rotate let's

264
00:10:28,040 --> 00:10:29,720
link this down or something something so

265
00:10:29,720 --> 00:10:30,959
I can

266
00:10:30,959 --> 00:10:33,839
like that's not good at all let's do

267
00:10:33,839 --> 00:10:37,279
control R I think I need to just do the

268
00:10:37,279 --> 00:10:39,560
hair needs to poke through a little bit

269
00:10:39,560 --> 00:10:42,639
like that and then here ah okay I've got

270
00:10:42,639 --> 00:10:45,560
some sort of a slit here 12 seconds to

271
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:50,560
go e to extrude G to move G to move e to

272
00:10:50,560 --> 00:10:54,959
extrude G to move rotate oh rotate and G

273
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,920
to move okay I I link them together by

274
00:10:56,920 --> 00:10:59,399
mistake ah let's just pretend that's not

275
00:10:59,399 --> 00:11:02,519
going off and H you TTR it

276
00:11:02,519 --> 00:11:05,279
ah it's not over I

277
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,440
refuse it's rigged it's rigged it's

278
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,800
rigged it's rigged I need to switch this

279
00:11:09,800 --> 00:11:12,040
thing off that's why I made it so

280
00:11:12,040 --> 00:11:15,079
loud uh it's like right on the buzzer

281
00:11:15,079 --> 00:11:17,240
isn't

282
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:22,279
it there we go

283
00:11:22,279 --> 00:11:25,720
just just made

284
00:11:27,600 --> 00:11:29,959
it okay

285
00:11:29,959 --> 00:11:32,079
I think I went 33 seconds over there but

286
00:11:32,079 --> 00:11:34,440
now we need to rescue this poor thing so

287
00:11:34,440 --> 00:11:36,600
I'm going to press contr s to save this

288
00:11:36,600 --> 00:11:39,320
and then now let's just see how we can

289
00:11:39,320 --> 00:11:42,800
salvage this thing so apologies for this

290
00:11:42,800 --> 00:11:45,399
hideous character maybe from a super

291
00:11:45,399 --> 00:11:47,399
long distance this would still work so

292
00:11:47,399 --> 00:11:48,839
but now let's see I'm actually going to

293
00:11:48,839 --> 00:11:51,519
duplicate this one and then let's work

294
00:11:51,519 --> 00:11:53,959
on this one

295
00:11:53,959 --> 00:11:57,160
first 10 min I call this one and then

296
00:11:57,160 --> 00:11:59,440
here I'm going to work on this one now

297
00:11:59,440 --> 00:12:01,079
okay so let's just analyze this thing in

298
00:12:01,079 --> 00:12:02,519
10 minutes like what went seriously

299
00:12:02,519 --> 00:12:04,120
wrong first of all I need to colorize

300
00:12:04,120 --> 00:12:07,000
this cuz I think uh what I usually do is

301
00:12:07,000 --> 00:12:09,040
I kept keep the same color mostly and I

302
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:12,079
just shade like on the neck or something

303
00:12:12,079 --> 00:12:13,279
what I'm going to do now is I'm going to

304
00:12:13,279 --> 00:12:15,639
move these to make it quite radically

305
00:12:15,639 --> 00:12:17,560
different the colors here and also I

306
00:12:17,560 --> 00:12:19,120
think up here in the forehead I think

307
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:21,639
the hair needs to come up a little bit

308
00:12:21,639 --> 00:12:24,600
so El select the link okay have I got

309
00:12:24,600 --> 00:12:26,839
two I've got two heads of hair or

310
00:12:26,839 --> 00:12:29,440
something all right delete don't know

311
00:12:29,440 --> 00:12:33,399
why I had two sets of hair oh did

312
00:12:33,399 --> 00:12:36,360
I no there we go El select link so that

313
00:12:36,360 --> 00:12:38,079
was one issue there I double sets of

314
00:12:38,079 --> 00:12:40,600
hair for some stupid reason uh so I'm

315
00:12:40,600 --> 00:12:42,279
not happy with the air here so I'm going

316
00:12:42,279 --> 00:12:45,920
to press control plus press delete faces

317
00:12:45,920 --> 00:12:47,839
and then I'll have to salvage this so L

318
00:12:47,839 --> 00:12:49,639
select the link here H to hide it this

319
00:12:49,639 --> 00:12:52,399
could be oh I've got everything's

320
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:55,720
duplicate why okay I must have pressed

321
00:12:55,720 --> 00:12:57,399
shift d by mistake so delete these ones

322
00:12:57,399 --> 00:12:59,199
as well then I guess this is duplicate l

323
00:12:59,199 --> 00:13:00,760
select the link yep all right delete

324
00:13:00,760 --> 00:13:04,240
those as well are the eyes duplicate l g

325
00:13:04,240 --> 00:13:06,360
y all right let's get rid of them too

326
00:13:06,360 --> 00:13:08,199
eyebrows I'm guessing L select the link

327
00:13:08,199 --> 00:13:09,800
G yeah they're duplicate everything's

328
00:13:09,800 --> 00:13:12,680
duplicate all right and then here now I

329
00:13:12,680 --> 00:13:14,399
can slash on the keyboard actually

330
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,199
pretty good if you high like this El

331
00:13:16,199 --> 00:13:17,800
select the link and then press slash

332
00:13:17,800 --> 00:13:19,279
okay that didn't work when I'm zoomed in

333
00:13:19,279 --> 00:13:21,639
so I'll just press control I and H to

334
00:13:21,639 --> 00:13:23,800
hide it then and I've got to link the

335
00:13:23,800 --> 00:13:25,959
hair up here again now cuz I I wasn't

336
00:13:25,959 --> 00:13:27,160
happy with what I was doing so I'm going

337
00:13:27,160 --> 00:13:29,120
to shift select these edges press F to

338
00:13:29,120 --> 00:13:32,440
to fill them F to fill F to fill and F

339
00:13:32,440 --> 00:13:34,920
to okay there we got an issue as

340
00:13:34,920 --> 00:13:38,320
well so I could not do that apparently

341
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:40,880
so let's link these instead them to F to

342
00:13:40,880 --> 00:13:42,000
select the

343
00:13:42,000 --> 00:13:44,639
link F to select the link oh this is the

344
00:13:44,639 --> 00:13:46,959
quad I want it there we go and here I

345
00:13:46,959 --> 00:13:48,800
think I'll do control R and I'll have to

346
00:13:48,800 --> 00:13:50,320
check the poly count later on but here

347
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:53,120
I'm going to do G to move and E to

348
00:13:53,120 --> 00:13:56,120
extrude part to rotate and I think

349
00:13:56,120 --> 00:13:57,720
that's better cuz now I I've got a space

350
00:13:57,720 --> 00:14:00,920
for my ear here so alt h on hides this

351
00:14:00,920 --> 00:14:03,320
face thing all right so what's like

352
00:14:03,320 --> 00:14:04,720
there's a billion things that I don't

353
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:05,920
like with this face but let's start

354
00:14:05,920 --> 00:14:08,560
fixing them one by one uh this I want to

355
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,639
change color so I'm going to change them

356
00:14:10,639 --> 00:14:12,639
one to like some darker even on a

357
00:14:12,639 --> 00:14:14,440
different Hue as well I want to have

358
00:14:14,440 --> 00:14:17,680
like really like Stark contrasts Tony

359
00:14:17,680 --> 00:14:20,000
Stark good film the first Iron Man was

360
00:14:20,000 --> 00:14:21,480
really good actually didn't really like

361
00:14:21,480 --> 00:14:22,759
the well the other ones are good too but

362
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,440
the first one was great so it's

363
00:14:24,440 --> 00:14:26,839
difficult to compete with that one so G

364
00:14:26,839 --> 00:14:28,360
okay maybe the front here needs to come

365
00:14:28,360 --> 00:14:31,199
down maybe this needs to come up so

366
00:14:31,199 --> 00:14:32,880
again I'm not using a reference for this

367
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:34,839
I'm just trying to like look at the

368
00:14:34,839 --> 00:14:36,560
thing and see like what am I unhappy

369
00:14:36,560 --> 00:14:38,320
with and then let's just try to fix one

370
00:14:38,320 --> 00:14:41,600
thing at a time so I'm going to go this

371
00:14:41,600 --> 00:14:43,360
feels like it needs to come in a little

372
00:14:43,360 --> 00:14:44,720
bit

373
00:14:44,720 --> 00:14:48,000
G and then here like leave some space

374
00:14:48,000 --> 00:14:50,560
for there I think the ear is not high

375
00:14:50,560 --> 00:14:53,839
enough so shift select those and G to

376
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:57,320
move that and then G this one sometimes

377
00:14:57,320 --> 00:14:59,560
I I keep the eyes ear

378
00:14:59,560 --> 00:15:02,040
did I say ear before or I I don't know

379
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:03,759
anyway I want to keep the ear part of

380
00:15:03,759 --> 00:15:06,519
the head now cuz usually I do like I do

381
00:15:06,519 --> 00:15:08,399
them separate but for some reason I want

382
00:15:08,399 --> 00:15:10,519
to keep that as part of the mesh now all

383
00:15:10,519 --> 00:15:12,959
right let's see what's uh this mouth

384
00:15:12,959 --> 00:15:14,839
thing is looking terrible so let's see

385
00:15:14,839 --> 00:15:18,040
what we can do here maybe I think the

386
00:15:18,040 --> 00:15:19,839
whole mouth needs to come up a little

387
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:22,759
bit cuz what is this what is this

388
00:15:22,759 --> 00:15:25,320
thing so it's a good thing I can like

389
00:15:25,320 --> 00:15:27,120
fix a few of these things now because

390
00:15:27,120 --> 00:15:28,680
the thumbnails like if I had it looking

391
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,880
like this I'd lose subscribers straight

392
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:33,279
away so

393
00:15:33,279 --> 00:15:38,440
G all said g and then GG to slide these

394
00:15:38,440 --> 00:15:41,720
down GG to slide I can have pretty small

395
00:15:41,720 --> 00:15:43,639
I I really want to try to keep the poly

396
00:15:43,639 --> 00:15:48,720
count pretty low and then G G and I

397
00:15:48,720 --> 00:15:53,040
think I want to color this okay this

398
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:59,440
should probably go in La still G

399
00:15:59,440 --> 00:16:03,800
rotate there we go g and ALT H to on

400
00:16:03,800 --> 00:16:06,040
hiide and then see what do we do here I

401
00:16:06,040 --> 00:16:09,199
need to link the beard and the here the

402
00:16:09,199 --> 00:16:10,440
hair

403
00:16:10,440 --> 00:16:13,319
up so let's see I wonder how much extra

404
00:16:13,319 --> 00:16:14,560
time we're going to end up getting on

405
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:18,199
this video now it's my own fault um I

406
00:16:18,199 --> 00:16:19,560
need to get faster or better or

407
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:20,839
something but that's what this is all

408
00:16:20,839 --> 00:16:23,160
about I need to PR what what is this uh

409
00:16:23,160 --> 00:16:25,440
hair do that he got going obviously he

410
00:16:25,440 --> 00:16:28,519
got more hair than I do hair do I do um

411
00:16:28,519 --> 00:16:30,279
but yeah this is the whole point of

412
00:16:30,279 --> 00:16:32,319
these exercises anyway I need to

413
00:16:32,319 --> 00:16:33,720
practice these things if you don't

414
00:16:33,720 --> 00:16:34,680
practice you're never going to get

415
00:16:34,680 --> 00:16:37,240
better so and there's clearly room for

416
00:16:37,240 --> 00:16:38,399
improvement

417
00:16:38,399 --> 00:16:41,519
here uh we can see that I can see

418
00:16:41,519 --> 00:16:42,680
clearly

419
00:16:42,680 --> 00:16:45,279
now and well I cannot actually cuz I

420
00:16:45,279 --> 00:16:48,040
need glasses but it's uh sometimes it's

421
00:16:48,040 --> 00:16:49,720
better to not see that well I guess if

422
00:16:49,720 --> 00:16:51,399
if you're unhappy with what things look

423
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,360
like so maybe e to extrude this one to

424
00:16:54,360 --> 00:16:57,000
or why am I like extruding it into the

425
00:16:57,000 --> 00:16:58,959
center am I off on my scales or

426
00:16:58,959 --> 00:17:02,600
something G to move that why is he like

427
00:17:02,600 --> 00:17:05,839
there we go so again I'm not happy with

428
00:17:05,839 --> 00:17:08,480
the fact that it goes like a bobble or

429
00:17:08,480 --> 00:17:10,039
whatever you call this thing so I'm

430
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,679
going to G to move this G okay I could

431
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:14,760
go proportional now probably and I have

432
00:17:14,760 --> 00:17:17,280
linked proportional off so I'm not

433
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,280
affecting the head underneath there so

434
00:17:20,280 --> 00:17:23,360
there we go there we go and because I

435
00:17:23,360 --> 00:17:25,679
need like NPCs for ultranova I need them

436
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,280
and I need like a few human quite a few

437
00:17:28,280 --> 00:17:30,720
humans and I don't want to go overboard

438
00:17:30,720 --> 00:17:32,039
with poly but I don't want to go

439
00:17:32,039 --> 00:17:35,200
underboard either overboard underboard

440
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:37,799
so I I need to practice these

441
00:17:37,799 --> 00:17:41,240
things so here we go that's a bit better

442
00:17:41,240 --> 00:17:43,120
and I think I I actually want to just

443
00:17:43,120 --> 00:17:46,559
link this hair all the way into let's

444
00:17:46,559 --> 00:17:48,880
extrude it again so G and E to extrude

445
00:17:48,880 --> 00:17:50,600
this one cuz I want I think I want to

446
00:17:50,600 --> 00:17:53,840
link these up like this maybe I'll even

447
00:17:53,840 --> 00:17:55,159
actually to the point where I'm going to

448
00:17:55,159 --> 00:17:56,480
bridge these I think that's what I'm

449
00:17:56,480 --> 00:17:57,960
going to do I'm going to shift select

450
00:17:57,960 --> 00:17:59,320
that one shift select that on right

451
00:17:59,320 --> 00:18:01,440
click and the bridge faces that connects

452
00:18:01,440 --> 00:18:04,039
them like this so that's pretty good and

453
00:18:04,039 --> 00:18:06,000
then control R cuz I think I still want

454
00:18:06,000 --> 00:18:09,039
to have a little indentation here okay o

455
00:18:09,039 --> 00:18:12,200
for proportional off and S to scale it

456
00:18:12,200 --> 00:18:15,880
and G G there we go okay I still need to

457
00:18:15,880 --> 00:18:19,640
I think I need to bring this up to here

458
00:18:19,640 --> 00:18:22,600
and out a bit and now I think I want to

459
00:18:22,600 --> 00:18:25,159
okay so that beard all Z to see through

460
00:18:25,159 --> 00:18:28,880
and then G to slide this back G to slide

461
00:18:28,880 --> 00:18:30,840
that back and I'm going to get so many

462
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:33,080
comments now in the review saying like

463
00:18:33,080 --> 00:18:35,360
this is a false statement you said that

464
00:18:35,360 --> 00:18:37,720
you did this in 10 minutes and clearly

465
00:18:37,720 --> 00:18:40,039
you sat there for ages afterwards you're

466
00:18:40,039 --> 00:18:40,760
a

467
00:18:40,760 --> 00:18:45,720
liar but it's okay I can take it it's uh

468
00:18:45,720 --> 00:18:47,559
I still model something in 10 minutes

469
00:18:47,559 --> 00:18:49,440
it's just that it required some

470
00:18:49,440 --> 00:18:51,200
salvaging anyway I think I'm going to

471
00:18:51,200 --> 00:18:53,640
change this as well now and I'm going to

472
00:18:53,640 --> 00:18:57,120
go for a different Hue here there we go

473
00:18:57,120 --> 00:18:58,559
I don't know it doesn't make much sense

474
00:18:58,559 --> 00:19:00,679
now but I think it might do in a second

475
00:19:00,679 --> 00:19:03,039
so here I'm going to move this

476
00:19:03,039 --> 00:19:05,679
up and I'm going to put some virtual

477
00:19:05,679 --> 00:19:08,000
Shadow on this stuff now I think I'm

478
00:19:08,000 --> 00:19:09,440
going to also bring this part of the

479
00:19:09,440 --> 00:19:10,360
beard

480
00:19:10,360 --> 00:19:14,080
in and

481
00:19:14,080 --> 00:19:17,120
G and I'm going to also extrude the must

482
00:19:17,120 --> 00:19:20,159
mustache one more time maybe control

483
00:19:20,159 --> 00:19:21,760
okay I'm I'm putting too many polygons

484
00:19:21,760 --> 00:19:24,640
on actually so e to extrude that on

485
00:19:24,640 --> 00:19:27,960
scale it G and then let's go I'm not

486
00:19:27,960 --> 00:19:29,559
going to put any more polygons here now

487
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:31,640
cuz I'm already feeling like I'm going a

488
00:19:31,640 --> 00:19:35,760
bit too too much here but it's okay

489
00:19:35,760 --> 00:19:38,559
there we go and the nose is uh okay I'm

490
00:19:38,559 --> 00:19:41,960
going to bring this in L select the link

491
00:19:41,960 --> 00:19:43,960
here the eyes are too far out so I'm

492
00:19:43,960 --> 00:19:46,000
going to rotate

493
00:19:46,000 --> 00:19:48,919
them and a bit cartoony these eyes I

494
00:19:48,919 --> 00:19:53,440
understand so but I'm okay with that so

495
00:19:53,440 --> 00:19:57,039
G and okay so what what's still wrong

496
00:19:57,039 --> 00:20:00,600
here I'm going to do bring that on down

497
00:20:00,600 --> 00:20:05,360
slightly this in and okay so maybe like

498
00:20:05,360 --> 00:20:07,520
that and I'm also going to change I

499
00:20:07,520 --> 00:20:10,799
think the color okay here needs to go

500
00:20:10,799 --> 00:20:13,400
darker it really needs to go dark in

501
00:20:13,400 --> 00:20:14,559
here I think

502
00:20:14,559 --> 00:20:20,200
like to that point am I missing a face

503
00:20:20,200 --> 00:20:23,000
yeah and with that done I think the lips

504
00:20:23,000 --> 00:20:25,799
will even have to go darker

505
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:29,400
too and then I'll bring this up to there

506
00:20:29,400 --> 00:20:30,640
and

507
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:34,799
then I'm not happy with uh that either

508
00:20:34,799 --> 00:20:37,799
so G to move that

509
00:20:37,799 --> 00:20:42,600
on G G I should have known like how to

510
00:20:42,600 --> 00:20:44,440
do this now because I did the the beard

511
00:20:44,440 --> 00:20:46,640
I guess for the other character that I

512
00:20:46,640 --> 00:20:49,760
made the the big boss that I did for my

513
00:20:49,760 --> 00:20:54,799
game so G and all right I think okay

514
00:20:54,799 --> 00:20:57,039
here's what I'm going to do now so I

515
00:20:57,039 --> 00:20:58,919
have to probably switch off uh mirror

516
00:20:58,919 --> 00:21:01,400
modifier at some point as well because I

517
00:21:01,400 --> 00:21:02,960
need and usually I always forget that I

518
00:21:02,960 --> 00:21:05,520
do that but the reason why I think I

519
00:21:05,520 --> 00:21:08,159
need to do it is because I need to have

520
00:21:08,159 --> 00:21:09,840
some

521
00:21:09,840 --> 00:21:12,000
irregularities going to shift select a

522
00:21:12,000 --> 00:21:14,159
bunch of these and then go darker here

523
00:21:14,159 --> 00:21:15,880
as well maybe under the ears there as

524
00:21:15,880 --> 00:21:17,919
well and I'm Shifting the Hue as well

525
00:21:17,919 --> 00:21:20,320
from a yellow or skin tone there to like

526
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:23,320
a redder color as if it was going darker

527
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,840
there all right so and then maybe I'm

528
00:21:26,840 --> 00:21:29,880
going to even put like a different color

529
00:21:29,880 --> 00:21:32,840
on

530
00:21:33,960 --> 00:21:37,000
here R there you go and now for the hair

531
00:21:37,000 --> 00:21:38,440
I'm actually going to throw different

532
00:21:38,440 --> 00:21:40,600
like shades of light like really light

533
00:21:40,600 --> 00:21:43,520
blue as well so on those I'm going to go

534
00:21:43,520 --> 00:21:46,640
on the left here Beats Box select those

535
00:21:46,640 --> 00:21:49,640
G and move them down to maybe

536
00:21:49,640 --> 00:21:53,720
here there we go okay that's too dark G

537
00:21:53,720 --> 00:21:54,440
and

538
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:57,000
then a few of these as well I think I'm

539
00:21:57,000 --> 00:22:00,080
going to do a few of those this is again

540
00:22:00,080 --> 00:22:02,480
like it it's like a cool shadow on them

541
00:22:02,480 --> 00:22:05,080
and I don't mean cool as in looking cool

542
00:22:05,080 --> 00:22:06,440
I just need them to have like a

543
00:22:06,440 --> 00:22:08,520
different color to to create contrast I

544
00:22:08,520 --> 00:22:10,240
think that's what my some of my stuff

545
00:22:10,240 --> 00:22:12,440
has been missing before in here I can

546
00:22:12,440 --> 00:22:14,400
probably go quite a lot darker but I'm

547
00:22:14,400 --> 00:22:16,080
not going to go gray dark I really want

548
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:19,720
to try to bring those Blues in so I get

549
00:22:19,720 --> 00:22:22,559
so it looks a bit like it's got like

550
00:22:22,559 --> 00:22:25,360
some tint on it so G to move all the way

551
00:22:25,360 --> 00:22:29,159
down to there I might do oh press two

552
00:22:29,159 --> 00:22:31,600
sometimes I scare myself when I do that

553
00:22:31,600 --> 00:22:33,720
quite often uh but when you press two

554
00:22:33,720 --> 00:22:35,000
sometimes when you're not in edit mode

555
00:22:35,000 --> 00:22:37,640
then what you're doing is basically

556
00:22:37,640 --> 00:22:41,279
hiding the collection so and I mistake

557
00:22:41,279 --> 00:22:43,120
that sometimes for like accidentally

558
00:22:43,120 --> 00:22:46,559
deleting something G all right so there

559
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:49,799
we go and here we can put some fake like

560
00:22:49,799 --> 00:22:51,960
Blues here as well maybe I'll go in like

561
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:54,559
super dark like that and this is looking

562
00:22:54,559 --> 00:22:56,919
super weird this one G oh what's

563
00:22:56,919 --> 00:22:59,240
happened here

564
00:22:59,240 --> 00:23:01,640
I've selected way too many here so

565
00:23:01,640 --> 00:23:05,440
control control select to here here here

566
00:23:05,440 --> 00:23:09,279
here here here hair hair G I'm just

567
00:23:09,279 --> 00:23:11,600
going to go for that lighter and then

568
00:23:11,600 --> 00:23:13,400
here I need to change as well how many

569
00:23:13,400 --> 00:23:16,559
Poes am I on now actually I have to

570
00:23:16,559 --> 00:23:21,559
check G and G and what's going on with

571
00:23:21,559 --> 00:23:24,880
the hair here here oh my

572
00:23:24,880 --> 00:23:28,919
God so I think I'm bring that on into

573
00:23:28,919 --> 00:23:31,279
G what what am I doing

574
00:23:31,279 --> 00:23:33,799
G there you go and the reason why I

575
00:23:33,799 --> 00:23:35,960
think I need to like apply I need to

576
00:23:35,960 --> 00:23:37,640
triangulate some parts as well because I

577
00:23:37,640 --> 00:23:40,000
cannot get the colorization i i Envision

578
00:23:40,000 --> 00:23:42,440
a little bit more like irregular

579
00:23:42,440 --> 00:23:45,120
coloring rather than these like clear

580
00:23:45,120 --> 00:23:47,559
squares so I think I want to Triangle it

581
00:23:47,559 --> 00:23:48,520
at some

582
00:23:48,520 --> 00:23:50,880
point um under the eyebrows I think I'm

583
00:23:50,880 --> 00:23:54,799
going to go dark as well there and maybe

584
00:23:54,799 --> 00:23:56,720
that that triangle could qualify to be

585
00:23:56,720 --> 00:23:59,200
darker do you think

586
00:23:59,200 --> 00:24:01,840
and some more saturation in there

587
00:24:01,840 --> 00:24:07,720
maybe could be G to move that one in and

588
00:24:07,720 --> 00:24:09,120
G okay now I'm going to just keep

589
00:24:09,120 --> 00:24:11,039
refining so this is like an old guy I

590
00:24:11,039 --> 00:24:12,840
think the problem is still that it's oh

591
00:24:12,840 --> 00:24:15,720
yeah like it's starting to look a little

592
00:24:15,720 --> 00:24:18,200
bit maybe I need

593
00:24:18,200 --> 00:24:23,640
to Al I I'll save this one for like mod

594
00:24:23,640 --> 00:24:26,520
one and then I just duplicate this one

595
00:24:26,520 --> 00:24:28,520
and save that on too so I'm going to put

596
00:24:28,520 --> 00:24:31,399
on my patreon as well so if anyone wants

597
00:24:31,399 --> 00:24:34,200
to like download these so my tutorial

598
00:24:34,200 --> 00:24:35,760
here on my patreon thank you so much

599
00:24:35,760 --> 00:24:37,919
patreons you guys are absolutely

600
00:24:37,919 --> 00:24:40,880
fantastic um I'm trying to do this for a

601
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:44,159
living it's not the easiest

602
00:24:45,000 --> 00:24:49,960
thing so I'll hide that one uh but so my

603
00:24:49,960 --> 00:24:52,360
I'm super grateful for your support So

604
00:24:52,360 --> 00:24:54,880
patreon's tutorial tiering up I guess

605
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:56,399
it's about time that I start uploading a

606
00:24:56,399 --> 00:24:58,559
few more of these I've uploaded uh and I

607
00:24:58,559 --> 00:25:00,000
usually do it in batches so I don't have

608
00:25:00,000 --> 00:25:02,279
to do it like after every week but I

609
00:25:02,279 --> 00:25:04,240
will uh probably look into uploading

610
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:06,080
another batch soon cuz I think it's been

611
00:25:06,080 --> 00:25:07,720
like quite a few so you'll be able to

612
00:25:07,720 --> 00:25:10,799
download these soon all right I need to

613
00:25:10,799 --> 00:25:15,520
bring this up I think rotate on the

614
00:25:15,799 --> 00:25:19,559
x-axis scale down and okay I'm T I'm I'm

615
00:25:19,559 --> 00:25:22,120
doing like tinkering

616
00:25:22,120 --> 00:25:25,200
now H oh I'm just trying to save

617
00:25:25,200 --> 00:25:28,520
something out of this G

618
00:25:28,520 --> 00:25:31,159
G all right

619
00:25:31,159 --> 00:25:34,480
so should I bring this one

620
00:25:34,480 --> 00:25:37,520
up to here

621
00:25:37,520 --> 00:25:41,080
even maybe and the hair is looking I'm

622
00:25:41,080 --> 00:25:43,640
not happy at all with the hair so I'm

623
00:25:43,640 --> 00:25:45,480
not I'm not sure why maybe it's too

624
00:25:45,480 --> 00:25:48,279
thick too much hair so I'm going to go

625
00:25:48,279 --> 00:25:50,880
proportional on this thing shift select

626
00:25:50,880 --> 00:25:53,080
the bunch and G to move it in I think

627
00:25:53,080 --> 00:25:55,840
it's too much hair I'm jealous that's

628
00:25:55,840 --> 00:25:59,039
what I'm trying to say G to move this

629
00:25:59,039 --> 00:26:01,840
in shift select shift select shift

630
00:26:01,840 --> 00:26:07,679
select shift select G G and G all right

631
00:26:07,679 --> 00:26:10,320
I'm still not happy with this so maybe

632
00:26:10,320 --> 00:26:12,279
if I bring let's see like do I bring

633
00:26:12,279 --> 00:26:14,120
that down well that created a little bit

634
00:26:14,120 --> 00:26:17,080
of definition on it it's like he's got

635
00:26:17,080 --> 00:26:19,799
something G wrot it now it looks like

636
00:26:19,799 --> 00:26:22,760
he's popping out of an eggshell for some

637
00:26:22,760 --> 00:26:26,279
reason I'm okay with that still g g okay

638
00:26:26,279 --> 00:26:29,120
so not happy with this

639
00:26:29,120 --> 00:26:33,279
this is too close not happy with this

640
00:26:33,279 --> 00:26:37,200
G not happy with that g

641
00:26:37,200 --> 00:26:40,840
g g hey I'm I'm imagining like a wizard

642
00:26:40,840 --> 00:26:42,080
or something here as well there's

643
00:26:42,080 --> 00:26:43,840
something that's really disturbing me

644
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,240
with the face and I cannot like exactly

645
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:48,440
like put my finger on what it is it's

646
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:51,000
well apart from it looking super strange

647
00:26:51,000 --> 00:26:53,520
so maybe El select the link hide this

648
00:26:53,520 --> 00:26:54,919
and then see well now we see what's

649
00:26:54,919 --> 00:26:57,559
going on here this is a problem so he's

650
00:26:57,559 --> 00:26:59,720
not meant to look happy so that's

651
00:26:59,720 --> 00:27:01,799
okay but I think I'm going to create

652
00:27:01,799 --> 00:27:03,919
even more def definition on his face

653
00:27:03,919 --> 00:27:06,679
here we'll colorize these a different

654
00:27:06,679 --> 00:27:09,760
color there and then this one as well

655
00:27:09,760 --> 00:27:13,120
maybe slightly darker and I really want

656
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:15,600
to get like a nearly like a fake low

657
00:27:15,600 --> 00:27:18,320
poly look like I drew it or

658
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:21,799
something and but I think that's okay

659
00:27:21,799 --> 00:27:23,080
and

660
00:27:23,080 --> 00:27:25,279
this I guess I should really extrude the

661
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:28,919
neck e extrude that's the scale

662
00:27:28,919 --> 00:27:30,559
and arer rotate but I'm not going to do

663
00:27:30,559 --> 00:27:32,360
any longer than that that's as far as

664
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,080
I'll go and we're not going to see this

665
00:27:35,080 --> 00:27:36,360
part of the head so I'm not going to

666
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:39,039
worry about the colorization in there so

667
00:27:39,039 --> 00:27:40,960
this is okay now I'm going to I might

668
00:27:40,960 --> 00:27:44,519
just bring the mouth out slightly

669
00:27:44,519 --> 00:27:47,039
G rotate and this is only for

670
00:27:47,039 --> 00:27:49,480
colorization that's why I've got the mou

671
00:27:49,480 --> 00:27:51,480
there like that or the mouth should go

672
00:27:51,480 --> 00:27:53,559
in

673
00:27:53,559 --> 00:27:55,960
maybe maybe this needs to come out I'll

674
00:27:55,960 --> 00:27:57,880
select the ring Loop there and bring

675
00:27:57,880 --> 00:28:00,480
this in no matter what I do uh it's

676
00:28:00,480 --> 00:28:02,480
apparently looking not good so let's put

677
00:28:02,480 --> 00:28:05,519
the hair back alt H there we go that

678
00:28:05,519 --> 00:28:06,840
saved it

679
00:28:06,840 --> 00:28:09,720
and we've got maybe this is coming out

680
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:12,880
to more much yeah that's better we need

681
00:28:12,880 --> 00:28:14,840
to reveal the air ear I think a little

682
00:28:14,840 --> 00:28:17,519
bit more there we go old said to see oh

683
00:28:17,519 --> 00:28:18,840
it's starting to difficult now I have to

684
00:28:18,840 --> 00:28:21,640
check the poly count

685
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:26,600
now uh g s that on and

686
00:28:26,600 --> 00:28:28,960
one I have no no idea how much extra

687
00:28:28,960 --> 00:28:32,760
time I put this control r g okay that's

688
00:28:32,760 --> 00:28:34,640
a bit better as well I'm just trying to

689
00:28:34,640 --> 00:28:36,519
create like definition in the face

690
00:28:36,519 --> 00:28:38,399
that's what I'm after so it's not like

691
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,320
super like

692
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:45,279
Bland maybe this needs to come in

693
00:28:45,519 --> 00:28:48,840
rotate yeah that's good G well I I

694
00:28:48,840 --> 00:28:50,480
wouldn't say it's good but

695
00:28:50,480 --> 00:28:54,960
it's somewhere something all right G

696
00:28:54,960 --> 00:28:58,679
here we go all right so let's just try

697
00:28:58,679 --> 00:29:00,960
to do some radical like changes here so

698
00:29:00,960 --> 00:29:03,039
if I change that vert is that better or

699
00:29:03,039 --> 00:29:05,039
worse that's pretty interesting like I'm

700
00:29:05,039 --> 00:29:06,679
bringing the eyebrow that's could be

701
00:29:06,679 --> 00:29:08,799
interesting okay let's try this vert

702
00:29:08,799 --> 00:29:10,159
single verts here in the face will

703
00:29:10,159 --> 00:29:12,159
actually make a big difference so you

704
00:29:12,159 --> 00:29:14,080
can really change the like the look of a

705
00:29:14,080 --> 00:29:16,039
face here if he wants to be like s like

706
00:29:16,039 --> 00:29:18,159
a a boner

707
00:29:18,159 --> 00:29:21,720
face more narrow bigger cheekbones there

708
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:24,039
we go and then probably the nose I'm

709
00:29:24,039 --> 00:29:26,399
guessing you can like that'll change the

710
00:29:26,399 --> 00:29:28,640
face quite a bit but I'm okay that one I

711
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:31,840
think maybe let's try that ver and see G

712
00:29:31,840 --> 00:29:34,039
you can do like a narrower nose like

713
00:29:34,039 --> 00:29:37,200
that or a wider I think that's all right

714
00:29:37,200 --> 00:29:40,440
and I'm guessing this beard is um or

715
00:29:40,440 --> 00:29:42,000
this mustache maybe that's what it is

716
00:29:42,000 --> 00:29:44,039
that's too too

717
00:29:44,039 --> 00:29:46,760
big G to move that and I'm going to

718
00:29:46,760 --> 00:29:49,000
change these as well color-wise

719
00:29:49,000 --> 00:29:52,880
G again I'm going to shift into like a

720
00:29:52,880 --> 00:29:55,360
darker it's still light but like a

721
00:29:55,360 --> 00:29:57,440
darker color at least and let's do these

722
00:29:57,440 --> 00:30:00,039
as well

723
00:30:00,519 --> 00:30:04,320
G that can go darker there we go and O

724
00:30:04,320 --> 00:30:06,360
there we go I pressed number two

725
00:30:06,360 --> 00:30:10,480
again G and okay this vert is probably

726
00:30:10,480 --> 00:30:12,320
going to be a problem alt Z to see

727
00:30:12,320 --> 00:30:13,840
through that one I need to move down I

728
00:30:13,840 --> 00:30:17,039
think cuz when I do my shape key soon

729
00:30:17,039 --> 00:30:18,679
going to have and then that creates a

730
00:30:18,679 --> 00:30:20,480
problem for the

731
00:30:20,480 --> 00:30:23,210
ear so let's bring that down to

732
00:30:23,210 --> 00:30:25,360
[Music]

733
00:30:25,360 --> 00:30:29,240
there there and there there there

734
00:30:29,240 --> 00:30:32,440
here all ti so okay that one can go

735
00:30:32,440 --> 00:30:34,240
darker too I'm not going to be too

736
00:30:34,240 --> 00:30:36,519
afraid of like putting you see like

737
00:30:36,519 --> 00:30:38,480
these blue shap like like the blue

738
00:30:38,480 --> 00:30:41,159
colors now I think that actually helps

739
00:30:41,159 --> 00:30:42,279
it just look a little bit more

740
00:30:42,279 --> 00:30:43,840
interesting it's not natur like it's not

741
00:30:43,840 --> 00:30:46,440
real light that's falling on it but it's

742
00:30:46,440 --> 00:30:48,279
creates the illusion maybe of light so

743
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:51,240
maybe like that here we can also go to

744
00:30:51,240 --> 00:30:52,799
like that

745
00:30:52,799 --> 00:30:56,039
color and here let's go a little bit

746
00:30:56,039 --> 00:30:58,000
darker there I think that's all right

747
00:30:58,000 --> 00:30:59,880
all right and the hair obviously I think

748
00:30:59,880 --> 00:31:01,240
it's because it's like perfectly

749
00:31:01,240 --> 00:31:03,679
symmetrical I think that's one of the

750
00:31:03,679 --> 00:31:07,399
issues so ideally you should probably

751
00:31:07,399 --> 00:31:11,039
have let's go proportional G move this

752
00:31:11,039 --> 00:31:13,760
one in a bit

753
00:31:14,279 --> 00:31:17,970
more there we go and maybe when

754
00:31:17,970 --> 00:31:19,120
[Music]

755
00:31:19,120 --> 00:31:22,360
I when I apply the mirror modifier we

756
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:25,600
can throw some different shapes on

757
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,919
there all right so there we go

758
00:31:30,440 --> 00:31:32,880
oh G OG

759
00:31:32,880 --> 00:31:36,320
OG all right I'm going to have to call

760
00:31:36,320 --> 00:31:39,120
it quits there I guess maybe dark behind

761
00:31:39,120 --> 00:31:42,240
the ear asn't washed

762
00:31:42,240 --> 00:31:44,519
there but that's all

763
00:31:44,519 --> 00:31:47,760
right okay so at least I'm happier with

764
00:31:47,760 --> 00:31:49,519
this pH anyway I can imagine in a game

765
00:31:49,519 --> 00:31:52,840
and now let's let's put uh all right

766
00:31:52,840 --> 00:31:54,639
what should I do first I'm going to do

767
00:31:54,639 --> 00:31:57,039
so mod two we'll call this one there we

768
00:31:57,039 --> 00:31:58,679
go and then I'm going to shift duplicate

769
00:31:58,679 --> 00:32:02,080
this one and see El select link have I

770
00:32:02,080 --> 00:32:04,279
got duplicate geometry here again no

771
00:32:04,279 --> 00:32:05,399
that looks

772
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:08,600
hideous I don't know if uh these need

773
00:32:08,600 --> 00:32:11,240
changing too it's like a cartoon style

774
00:32:11,240 --> 00:32:13,480
eye think you can change the appearance

775
00:32:13,480 --> 00:32:16,159
quite a lot of the character like if the

776
00:32:16,159 --> 00:32:19,880
eyes are narrow or far apart or

777
00:32:19,880 --> 00:32:24,360
bigger okay don't know and I might also

778
00:32:24,360 --> 00:32:25,799
like think of a character where I don't

779
00:32:25,799 --> 00:32:27,639
have like these little eyes but I think

780
00:32:27,639 --> 00:32:31,559
that will work for what I need and G to

781
00:32:31,559 --> 00:32:34,760
move on all right that should work maybe

782
00:32:34,760 --> 00:32:36,639
slightly darker under the

783
00:32:36,639 --> 00:32:38,279
nose

784
00:32:38,279 --> 00:32:40,000
there

785
00:32:40,000 --> 00:32:42,320
and here I think I'm going to go even

786
00:32:42,320 --> 00:32:44,440
darker on the blue there nearly to a

787
00:32:44,440 --> 00:32:49,360
black all right and

788
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:55,120
two G and these should probably also be

789
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:59,840
blue too dark there we go

790
00:33:02,000 --> 00:33:03,519
okay maybe someone can put in the

791
00:33:03,519 --> 00:33:05,799
comments like why is the hair looking so

792
00:33:05,799 --> 00:33:07,600
bad there's something about the hair

793
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:10,200
either it's too big or it's just that

794
00:33:10,200 --> 00:33:13,360
it's too uniform so now I'm going to

795
00:33:13,360 --> 00:33:14,880
regret applying the mirror modifier

796
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:17,039
because then but I think I need to do it

797
00:33:17,039 --> 00:33:18,720
just so I can get some different uh

798
00:33:18,720 --> 00:33:20,120
shapes on the hair otherwise the hair

799
00:33:20,120 --> 00:33:22,360
will be perfectly symmetrical like this

800
00:33:22,360 --> 00:33:24,320
so I'm going to regret this in a minute

801
00:33:24,320 --> 00:33:26,120
but I'm going to do apply mirror

802
00:33:26,120 --> 00:33:29,000
modifier here so going to do contr a on

803
00:33:29,000 --> 00:33:31,159
it and now I'm already going to start

804
00:33:31,159 --> 00:33:32,960
regretting this but I just wanted to see

805
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:35,159
if we can get a little bit different

806
00:33:35,159 --> 00:33:38,880
like shape the hair so I can imagine

807
00:33:38,880 --> 00:33:43,679
maybe here this one e to extrude as the

808
00:33:43,679 --> 00:33:47,559
scale Control Plus G okay oh we need

809
00:33:47,559 --> 00:33:49,200
proportional

810
00:33:49,200 --> 00:33:53,039
G rotate G I have no idea if this is

811
00:33:53,039 --> 00:33:55,120
actually what the problem is but it

812
00:33:55,120 --> 00:33:58,039
feels like it is and I might triangular

813
00:33:58,039 --> 00:34:01,600
just triangulate just the

814
00:34:01,600 --> 00:34:03,880
hair I think that's what put me off that

815
00:34:03,880 --> 00:34:07,559
the hair is a bunch of

816
00:34:08,040 --> 00:34:12,560
quads and g g g and maybe it just needs

817
00:34:12,560 --> 00:34:15,879
layering or something there

818
00:34:16,200 --> 00:34:18,919
here I have no idea but let's do L

819
00:34:18,919 --> 00:34:21,320
select the link here and then contrl T

820
00:34:21,320 --> 00:34:23,079
to try angulate

821
00:34:23,079 --> 00:34:26,679
that and put some okay maybe I'll just

822
00:34:26,679 --> 00:34:28,960
randomly select a few few vers here so

823
00:34:28,960 --> 00:34:30,639
I'm going to shift select a bunch of

824
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:33,839
random ones like this I know you can do

825
00:34:33,839 --> 00:34:35,679
select random as well but I think I just

826
00:34:35,679 --> 00:34:37,839
want it a little bit controlled alt s

827
00:34:37,839 --> 00:34:40,159
now to

828
00:34:40,159 --> 00:34:42,879
scale on

829
00:34:42,879 --> 00:34:46,760
the with proportional

830
00:34:47,040 --> 00:34:49,159
without I'm not sure what I'm trying to

831
00:34:49,159 --> 00:34:52,079
do here so

832
00:34:52,679 --> 00:34:54,359
G

833
00:34:54,359 --> 00:34:56,160
G

834
00:34:56,160 --> 00:34:59,640
and G

835
00:35:00,079 --> 00:35:01,400
maybe I need to color the different

836
00:35:01,400 --> 00:35:02,760
triangles a little bit as well maybe

837
00:35:02,760 --> 00:35:04,960
that's what it is oh he needs like the

838
00:35:04,960 --> 00:35:08,160
hair to the side like this maybe or

839
00:35:08,160 --> 00:35:10,400
something and then I'll bring actually

840
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,119
this down and maybe he needs a little

841
00:35:12,119 --> 00:35:13,400
like a little part here maybe that's

842
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,200
what it is so this is I I've never

843
00:35:16,200 --> 00:35:17,760
really done hair like this before so

844
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,920
that's why I'm like a bit

845
00:35:20,920 --> 00:35:25,880
lost to say the least uh rotate G I

846
00:35:25,880 --> 00:35:27,960
think I just need it to be like bit

847
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:30,680
different anyway and then like usually

848
00:35:30,680 --> 00:35:32,359
it swirls here doesn't it for the people

849
00:35:32,359 --> 00:35:34,000
that do have quite a lot of hair still

850
00:35:34,000 --> 00:35:36,960
you probably know if they it swirls here

851
00:35:36,960 --> 00:35:38,359
so we'll do

852
00:35:38,359 --> 00:35:42,880
that g g g and here I can probably go a

853
00:35:42,880 --> 00:35:44,680
little bit crazier as well

854
00:35:44,680 --> 00:35:48,040
g go crazy I moved it like moved it like

855
00:35:48,040 --> 00:35:50,319
half a

856
00:35:50,319 --> 00:35:54,599
centimeter G all right and then if I try

857
00:35:54,599 --> 00:35:57,079
to there's something here okay this

858
00:35:57,079 --> 00:35:58,440
maybe it needs come out a little bit

859
00:35:58,440 --> 00:36:00,599
more sorry for occupying your time now

860
00:36:00,599 --> 00:36:03,280
while I'm like just trying to figure out

861
00:36:03,280 --> 00:36:05,839
like what what is going on here with

862
00:36:05,839 --> 00:36:12,119
this rotate g g rotate what am I doing

863
00:36:12,119 --> 00:36:13,880
okay so that's the hair there now I'm

864
00:36:13,880 --> 00:36:15,880
just going to randomly select a few like

865
00:36:15,880 --> 00:36:17,720
triangles maybe these especially where

866
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:19,760
it's like on the

867
00:36:19,760 --> 00:36:22,520
part select a few of them and then just

868
00:36:22,520 --> 00:36:26,400
go to like the Bluer color there as well

869
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:28,680
there we go so creates like a fake

870
00:36:28,680 --> 00:36:31,119
Shadow maybe these will go in even

871
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:33,200
darker a little bit not going to be

872
00:36:33,200 --> 00:36:35,160
afraid of putting them quite super dark

873
00:36:35,160 --> 00:36:37,280
like that cuz it just looks like it's a

874
00:36:37,280 --> 00:36:39,560
bit more

875
00:36:39,599 --> 00:36:42,920
shade and here maybe we'll do so I'm

876
00:36:42,920 --> 00:36:44,880
going to actually remove the shade from

877
00:36:44,880 --> 00:36:47,560
these cuz it feels like they would like

878
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,240
get a little bit lighter even or maybe

879
00:36:49,240 --> 00:36:52,640
we can keep a light blue on

880
00:36:53,400 --> 00:36:58,240
there it just okay maybe this will help

881
00:36:58,240 --> 00:37:01,160
yes there we go little bit of hair

882
00:37:01,160 --> 00:37:02,280
hanging

883
00:37:02,280 --> 00:37:06,000
down and some random here as well there

884
00:37:06,000 --> 00:37:09,040
there there there there I I don't know

885
00:37:09,040 --> 00:37:12,280
if this works but what do you guys think

886
00:37:12,280 --> 00:37:14,839
like does it help with that those colors

887
00:37:14,839 --> 00:37:17,880
and I think this needs to come in oh

888
00:37:17,880 --> 00:37:20,040
select the link

889
00:37:20,040 --> 00:37:22,880
G this keeps reminding me of like that I

890
00:37:22,880 --> 00:37:24,480
heard a story when I was a kid my mom

891
00:37:24,480 --> 00:37:27,599
told me it was uh like someone made soup

892
00:37:27,599 --> 00:37:32,000
from just a a rusty nail and the point I

893
00:37:32,000 --> 00:37:33,119
I don't know it's probably got a famous

894
00:37:33,119 --> 00:37:34,280
name or something and it's probably a

895
00:37:34,280 --> 00:37:35,720
famous story but it's something about

896
00:37:35,720 --> 00:37:39,599
you can C cook a bowl of soup on just a

897
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:41,160
rusty nail and nothing else bowl of

898
00:37:41,160 --> 00:37:43,800
water and and soup and then it just said

899
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:45,400
yeah but you know what it'd be slightly

900
00:37:45,400 --> 00:37:47,440
nicer if you just added a bit of stock

901
00:37:47,440 --> 00:37:50,079
to it and then he said yeah but it's if

902
00:37:50,079 --> 00:37:52,160
you just add a little bit of vegge it'll

903
00:37:52,160 --> 00:37:54,760
become a little bit better so and then

904
00:37:54,760 --> 00:37:56,520
it keeps adding and adding more and more

905
00:37:56,520 --> 00:37:58,680
things to the soup and and then people

906
00:37:58,680 --> 00:38:00,599
were super impressed by the end cuz they

907
00:38:00,599 --> 00:38:02,680
managed to make a bowl of soup on just

908
00:38:02,680 --> 00:38:05,480
one Rusty Nail but in fact a lot of

909
00:38:05,480 --> 00:38:07,480
stuff was added so I feel a bit like

910
00:38:07,480 --> 00:38:09,359
that I just keep like in 10 minutes I

911
00:38:09,359 --> 00:38:10,839
did this face and then it looked

912
00:38:10,839 --> 00:38:13,640
absolutely ridiculous and then it I just

913
00:38:13,640 --> 00:38:16,240
had to keep adding until I was happy but

914
00:38:16,240 --> 00:38:17,400
I think I'm going to do a few of these

915
00:38:17,400 --> 00:38:20,079
faces I need to like if I make like a

916
00:38:20,079 --> 00:38:22,160
phase like this a week or something I

917
00:38:22,160 --> 00:38:24,599
think in the end it could probably work

918
00:38:24,599 --> 00:38:27,040
out to to looking something decent how

919
00:38:27,040 --> 00:38:29,280
many have we got now so this is I've

920
00:38:29,280 --> 00:38:31,640
applied the mirror modifier now so we're

921
00:38:31,640 --> 00:38:34,640
at 458 vers and I was aiming for between

922
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:36,520
2 and 300 before I applied the mirror

923
00:38:36,520 --> 00:38:37,960
modifier so I think I'm still like in

924
00:38:37,960 --> 00:38:41,000
the ballpark there and I'm also going to

925
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:43,400
just try to change the okay here's where

926
00:38:43,400 --> 00:38:45,079
I'm going to actually not like this now

927
00:38:45,079 --> 00:38:47,680
oh that's that could be good

928
00:38:47,680 --> 00:38:50,640
actually so actually like that a bit

929
00:38:50,640 --> 00:38:54,599
more scale that on down in like

930
00:38:54,599 --> 00:38:57,800
that and maybe we'll color eyes it feels

931
00:38:57,800 --> 00:39:00,160
like I've I've said like nine half

932
00:39:00,160 --> 00:39:01,960
finished sentences now so sorry about

933
00:39:01,960 --> 00:39:04,200
that should probably try to think about

934
00:39:04,200 --> 00:39:05,520
what I'm saying a little bit more and

935
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:08,000
complete my sentences but never

936
00:39:08,000 --> 00:39:11,119
mind and there we go so now I'm going to

937
00:39:11,119 --> 00:39:12,880
just uh I'll save this one again and

938
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:14,960
then I'll put some shape keys on now cuz

939
00:39:14,960 --> 00:39:16,440
I think I want to be able to animate

940
00:39:16,440 --> 00:39:19,280
this so like when they speak in a game I

941
00:39:19,280 --> 00:39:21,520
want to have just like blinking will do

942
00:39:21,520 --> 00:39:23,480
a huge thing I think plus you can do a

943
00:39:23,480 --> 00:39:24,880
lot of Expressions just with your

944
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:27,400
eyebrows so like if you do okay now I'm

945
00:39:27,400 --> 00:39:29,800
already annoying I'm not annoying I'm

946
00:39:29,800 --> 00:39:32,480
annoyed well I am annoying as well but

947
00:39:32,480 --> 00:39:35,839
uh now I like I'm raising one ey bro

948
00:39:35,839 --> 00:39:38,040
okay and this is too uniform the

949
00:39:38,040 --> 00:39:40,839
mustache GE since I've got the power now

950
00:39:40,839 --> 00:39:44,079
of not uh being symmetrical but then I

951
00:39:44,079 --> 00:39:45,160
actually want that to be a little bit

952
00:39:45,160 --> 00:39:47,200
more symmetrical anyway let's go to this

953
00:39:47,200 --> 00:39:50,920
one now the vert Tab and am I recording

954
00:39:50,920 --> 00:39:54,319
my screen properly yeah good it's a good

955
00:39:54,319 --> 00:39:56,640
thing to check now I'm going to add the

956
00:39:56,640 --> 00:40:00,280
shape Keys here here so plus there no no

957
00:40:00,280 --> 00:40:02,079
no not there here shape keys and then

958
00:40:02,079 --> 00:40:04,000
I'm going to do plus again and then I'm

959
00:40:04,000 --> 00:40:07,160
going to call blink here and now I'll

960
00:40:07,160 --> 00:40:09,440
tab into edit mode and then I'm going to

961
00:40:09,440 --> 00:40:10,800
now I have to do everything double

962
00:40:10,800 --> 00:40:12,520
actually can I do this I can enable this

963
00:40:12,520 --> 00:40:15,960
one little thing up here the

964
00:40:15,960 --> 00:40:18,160
mirror thing yeah there you go so it's

965
00:40:18,160 --> 00:40:19,640
nearly like having a mirror modifier but

966
00:40:19,640 --> 00:40:21,280
you can actually edit if the verts are

967
00:40:21,280 --> 00:40:22,760
in the same place on both sides and I

968
00:40:22,760 --> 00:40:24,839
haven't done anything to the face that's

969
00:40:24,839 --> 00:40:27,440
asymmetrical so now I can actually use

970
00:40:27,440 --> 00:40:28,920
even without the mirror modifier I can

971
00:40:28,920 --> 00:40:30,680
actually get these things going with the

972
00:40:30,680 --> 00:40:32,880
Symmetry on the x-axis so I'm going to

973
00:40:32,880 --> 00:40:34,560
create a blinking animation now so I'm

974
00:40:34,560 --> 00:40:38,160
just going to like move these down G

975
00:40:38,160 --> 00:40:40,040
this one down and this is going to come

976
00:40:40,040 --> 00:40:43,599
up a little bit to meet and then G to

977
00:40:43,599 --> 00:40:46,359
move this down and I guess I'll have to

978
00:40:46,359 --> 00:40:48,040
move this whole nose section down a

979
00:40:48,040 --> 00:40:51,800
little bit G and the beautiful thing is

980
00:40:51,800 --> 00:40:53,760
I can

981
00:40:53,760 --> 00:40:57,400
actually even like these now El select

982
00:40:57,400 --> 00:41:00,680
link El select the link scale Zed and

983
00:41:00,680 --> 00:41:02,240
then I'm going to move these in just

984
00:41:02,240 --> 00:41:05,680
into the head that's all right and then

985
00:41:05,680 --> 00:41:08,319
maybe I'll just tighten a bit there as

986
00:41:08,319 --> 00:41:10,480
well G G and the eyebrows I guess will

987
00:41:10,480 --> 00:41:12,920
have to come down as well l l and I

988
00:41:12,920 --> 00:41:15,680
slide them down and then I'm just going

989
00:41:15,680 --> 00:41:17,400
to how how would these rotate would they

990
00:41:17,400 --> 00:41:18,960
rotate like this if he

991
00:41:18,960 --> 00:41:21,720
blinks rotate I don't know and then

992
00:41:21,720 --> 00:41:24,200
these verts I think I need to just hide

993
00:41:24,200 --> 00:41:27,079
so El let's see I'll do El select the

994
00:41:27,079 --> 00:41:29,880
link all set to see through scale on the

995
00:41:29,880 --> 00:41:33,440
Z axis cuz I'm just going to scale

996
00:41:33,440 --> 00:41:35,760
oop what am I doing there material

997
00:41:35,760 --> 00:41:38,920
improve scale on the Zed axis and G so

998
00:41:38,920 --> 00:41:42,640
I'm okay with that so now if I Tab out

999
00:41:42,640 --> 00:41:44,240
edit mode the blinking here now will

1000
00:41:44,240 --> 00:41:45,839
just be like that ding ding ding ding I

1001
00:41:45,839 --> 00:41:47,240
think that'll do quite a lot to the game

1002
00:41:47,240 --> 00:41:48,319
cuz if you're just looking at a

1003
00:41:48,319 --> 00:41:50,200
character and every now and and then

1004
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:51,440
they just blink I don't know if I should

1005
00:41:51,440 --> 00:41:53,400
have pulled the cheekbones up I think

1006
00:41:53,400 --> 00:41:55,079
I'm okay with that and then so that's

1007
00:41:55,079 --> 00:41:56,560
going to be the blink and then here I'm

1008
00:41:56,560 --> 00:41:59,599
going to do also so plus here to add one

1009
00:41:59,599 --> 00:42:01,160
more and I'm just going to do some sort

1010
00:42:01,160 --> 00:42:02,800
some sort of a speaking thing so we can

1011
00:42:02,800 --> 00:42:04,960
speak so

1012
00:42:04,960 --> 00:42:07,200
speak and here I'm going to go I'm not

1013
00:42:07,200 --> 00:42:09,400
happy with the mouse mouse with a mouth

1014
00:42:09,400 --> 00:42:12,160
here it's uh got some gaps and stuff but

1015
00:42:12,160 --> 00:42:13,960
never mind I'll fix that some other day

1016
00:42:13,960 --> 00:42:16,560
maybe so now I'm just going to do with

1017
00:42:16,560 --> 00:42:19,000
the mouth I'm going to go like I still

1018
00:42:19,000 --> 00:42:20,240
got symmetry so I'm going to make it

1019
00:42:20,240 --> 00:42:21,680
rounder I

1020
00:42:21,680 --> 00:42:29,319
think G G G and G G g g because now I

1021
00:42:29,319 --> 00:42:32,000
should be able to just make animations

1022
00:42:32,000 --> 00:42:33,920
with shape keys in the in the game

1023
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:36,720
engine and then I think also when he

1024
00:42:36,720 --> 00:42:39,240
speaks the like the mustache should move

1025
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:40,520
a little

1026
00:42:40,520 --> 00:42:43,160
bit and maybe this comes out maybe this

1027
00:42:43,160 --> 00:42:45,839
whole thing comes down a

1028
00:42:45,839 --> 00:42:49,040
bit rotate

1029
00:42:49,040 --> 00:42:53,480
G and how do we do there not too much I

1030
00:42:53,480 --> 00:42:55,839
guess I wonder if it should move down

1031
00:42:55,839 --> 00:42:59,119
here as well maybe

1032
00:42:59,800 --> 00:43:03,440
G G and I don't know let's try it out so

1033
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:06,960
there you go that's not so good I need

1034
00:43:06,960 --> 00:43:10,680
to do more movement

1035
00:43:10,680 --> 00:43:13,599
here so I think more radical movement is

1036
00:43:13,599 --> 00:43:15,319
what's needed so I'll

1037
00:43:15,319 --> 00:43:19,280
do bigger change here there there

1038
00:43:19,280 --> 00:43:21,040
proportional let's go proportional and

1039
00:43:21,040 --> 00:43:22,880
the whole thing now is going to move

1040
00:43:22,880 --> 00:43:26,480
like down a bit oh no this this moves up

1041
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,839
I guess when

1042
00:43:27,839 --> 00:43:31,720
speaks and this goes down a bit and

1043
00:43:31,720 --> 00:43:35,880
rotate and then this goes

1044
00:43:36,440 --> 00:43:39,839
down to there I don't know this one this

1045
00:43:39,839 --> 00:43:41,880
one's a bit

1046
00:43:41,880 --> 00:43:43,400
tricky

1047
00:43:43,400 --> 00:43:47,800
g g g g or maybe the like the jaw bones

1048
00:43:47,800 --> 00:43:51,240
need to change a little bit too

1049
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:55,880
here so when you round the mouth you'd

1050
00:43:55,880 --> 00:43:58,040
probably there maybe slightly on the

1051
00:43:58,040 --> 00:44:00,480
nose as well I don't know I can imagine

1052
00:44:00,480 --> 00:44:02,680
that would be affected if you speak

1053
00:44:02,680 --> 00:44:05,240
would it so now we'll try

1054
00:44:05,240 --> 00:44:09,000
it yeah I think that'll do so again it's

1055
00:44:09,000 --> 00:44:11,000
just to get a little bit of uh movement

1056
00:44:11,000 --> 00:44:12,680
so like when a character speaks like

1057
00:44:12,680 --> 00:44:15,280
that you can

1058
00:44:15,599 --> 00:44:18,240
do maybe I'll do one with a closed as

1059
00:44:18,240 --> 00:44:21,119
well and I think what of an issue here

1060
00:44:21,119 --> 00:44:22,640
is I'm going to actually modify these

1061
00:44:22,640 --> 00:44:24,800
now and I'm going to bring this up a

1062
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:28,319
little bit I think I was uh

1063
00:44:28,319 --> 00:44:30,440
a bit unhappy with the the way this

1064
00:44:30,440 --> 00:44:32,559
looked

1065
00:44:32,559 --> 00:44:36,720
anyway cheat there we

1066
00:44:37,920 --> 00:44:41,400
go yeah that'll

1067
00:44:44,359 --> 00:44:49,520
do and then blink blink

1068
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:53,839
blink okay that'll

1069
00:44:53,839 --> 00:44:58,040
work all right so contrl s on that

1070
00:44:58,040 --> 00:45:00,960
that's um a good practice run so I think

1071
00:45:00,960 --> 00:45:03,400
it managed to salvage it maybe it's just

1072
00:45:03,400 --> 00:45:04,599
because I'm used to looking at it now

1073
00:45:04,599 --> 00:45:06,400
but from a distance I think this will be

1074
00:45:06,400 --> 00:45:08,200
good enough and tab interet mode we're

1075
00:45:08,200 --> 00:45:10,800
still under 500 Birds three 700 triangle

1076
00:45:10,800 --> 00:45:12,640
so it's pretty low

1077
00:45:12,640 --> 00:45:15,000
poly could probably do with removing

1078
00:45:15,000 --> 00:45:16,720
some triangles maybe on the head and

1079
00:45:16,720 --> 00:45:20,040
stuff but overall I think it'll work all

1080
00:45:20,040 --> 00:45:22,640
right give it let's see I have no idea

1081
00:45:22,640 --> 00:45:24,640
how long this took can I look at the

1082
00:45:24,640 --> 00:45:26,400
recording 47 minutes I've been recording

1083
00:45:26,400 --> 00:45:28,160
nearly I've been recording for a long

1084
00:45:28,160 --> 00:45:29,680
time anyway so I'm going to try to

1085
00:45:29,680 --> 00:45:30,880
compress it down a little bit for you

1086
00:45:30,880 --> 00:45:33,119
guys and have this compiled and uploaded

1087
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,240
cuz this is supposed to Premiere in like

1088
00:45:35,240 --> 00:45:37,760
uh 4 hours so I've got better just edit

1089
00:45:37,760 --> 00:45:40,160
this now and get it uploaded so give it

1090
00:45:40,160 --> 00:45:41,680
a thumbs up if you like the video and

1091
00:45:41,680 --> 00:45:43,280
don't forget to subscribe if you haven't

1092
00:45:43,280 --> 00:45:45,200

1093
00:45:45,200 --> 00:45:48,119
interested in my game on Fair Rampage

1094
00:45:48,119 --> 00:45:50,280
Nightfall that's a mouthful to say but

1095
00:45:50,280 --> 00:45:51,760
then you can uh wish list that as well

1096
00:45:51,760 --> 00:45:53,079
Link in the description I'm going to

1097
00:45:53,079 --> 00:45:54,800
launch that at the end of next month

1098
00:45:54,800 --> 00:45:57,160
probably so I need to get my wish list

1099
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,400
so I can actually have a like a spoka in

1100
00:46:00,400 --> 00:46:02,720
Swedish um a bit of a chance to to

1101
00:46:02,720 --> 00:46:04,640
actually make a few sales on that one so

1102
00:46:04,640 --> 00:46:06,240
feel free to do that and uh come back

1103
00:46:06,240 --> 00:46:07,680

1108
00:46:13,960 --> 00:46:16,040

1109
00:46:16,040 --> 00:46:18,480
outro instead of a long intro in this

00:46:18,480 --> 00:46:21,280
