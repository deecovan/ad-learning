00:00:00,160 --> 00:00:03,199
hello folks and welcome to episode 31 of

2
00:00:03,199 --> 00:00:04,720
the 10 minute modeling challenge which

3
00:00:04,720 --> 00:00:06,319
is turning out to be the 10 minute low

4
00:00:06,319 --> 00:00:07,680
polling modeling challenge but that's

5
00:00:07,680 --> 00:00:09,200
okay with me luckily enough i like low

6
00:00:09,200 --> 00:00:10,880
poly so i'll think i'll stick to that

7
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:11,679
style for now

8
00:00:11,679 --> 00:00:12,799
and then i'll have to practice some high

9
00:00:12,799 --> 00:00:14,880
poly in the future this week a few more

10
00:00:14,880 --> 00:00:16,800
merch samples came along so i tested

11
00:00:16,800 --> 00:00:18,400
those out to see what the quality was

12
00:00:18,400 --> 00:00:20,080
like and also what the prince was like

13
00:00:20,080 --> 00:00:21,920
otherwise i've also got a vacation this

14
00:00:21,920 --> 00:00:23,760
week so i'm not really working on the

15
00:00:23,760 --> 00:00:25,439
rts game at the moment but i'm still

16
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:27,039
trying to fit in videos and i've just

17
00:00:27,039 --> 00:00:27,840
recorded

18
00:00:27,840 --> 00:00:30,000
four hours of a unity tutorial that i'm

19
00:00:30,000 --> 00:00:31,920
editing now i'm hoping to release that

20
00:00:31,920 --> 00:00:32,800
in the next

21
00:00:32,800 --> 00:00:34,160
couple of days hopefully going to be an

22
00:00:34,160 --> 00:00:35,360
exciting one and it's going to be for

23
00:00:35,360 --> 00:00:37,040
the absolute beginners or people that

24
00:00:37,040 --> 00:00:38,480
want to make sure that they've covered

25
00:00:38,480 --> 00:00:39,360
all the basics

26
00:00:39,360 --> 00:00:40,559
and it's also going to teach you how to

27
00:00:40,559 --> 00:00:42,239
write your first c-sharp script if

28
00:00:42,239 --> 00:00:44,000
you're scared of that sort of stuff

29
00:00:44,000 --> 00:00:45,600
check that video out it's coming up very

30
00:00:45,600 --> 00:00:47,520
soon so with vacation been chilling a

31
00:00:47,520 --> 00:00:48,399
bit in the garden

32
00:00:48,399 --> 00:00:49,840
uh playing a lot with the kids the

33
00:00:49,840 --> 00:00:51,199
weather has been pretty nice so we've

34
00:00:51,199 --> 00:00:51,840
also been out

35
00:00:51,840 --> 00:00:53,760
for some walks around the area where i

36
00:00:53,760 --> 00:00:55,280
live here in nina sam

37
00:00:55,280 --> 00:00:58,000
in sweden and uh saw some boats that i

38
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,520
will never be able to afford probably

39
00:00:59,520 --> 00:01:00,719
but it was nice to see them

40
00:01:00,719 --> 00:01:02,000
and we've been riding some bikes a

41
00:01:02,000 --> 00:01:03,600
little bit mainly the kids may have just

42
00:01:03,600 --> 00:01:05,040
learned how to ride bicycle the other

43
00:01:05,040 --> 00:01:06,880
day so she's like going up and down the

44
00:01:06,880 --> 00:01:09,200
street

45
00:01:09,680 --> 00:01:11,280
then i even hopped on mine for a few

46
00:01:11,280 --> 00:01:12,960
minutes as well brush up on my wheelie

47
00:01:12,960 --> 00:01:15,040
skills

48
00:01:15,040 --> 00:01:16,720
that said we're gonna go into today's

49
00:01:16,720 --> 00:01:18,720
topic if you've seen those isometric

50
00:01:18,720 --> 00:01:19,600
pixel art

51
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:21,439
images of the little city blocks or

52
00:01:21,439 --> 00:01:22,799
something like that i guess it's a bit

53
00:01:22,799 --> 00:01:24,640
like a diorama i'm gonna model like a

54
00:01:24,640 --> 00:01:26,240
little slice out of a town

55
00:01:26,240 --> 00:01:28,320
and make it the so it should hopefully

56
00:01:28,320 --> 00:01:29,360
look alright in

57
00:01:29,360 --> 00:01:32,079
isometric view so basically that's just

58
00:01:32,079 --> 00:01:32,560
uh

59
00:01:32,560 --> 00:01:34,799
orthographic non-perspective but you

60
00:01:34,799 --> 00:01:37,040
have an angle to it so it looks a little

61
00:01:37,040 --> 00:01:37,360
bit

62
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,680
weird sometimes but the style could look

63
00:01:39,680 --> 00:01:41,280
pretty cute as well especially for pixel

64
00:01:41,280 --> 00:01:42,560
art it looks good so maybe it'll work

65
00:01:42,560 --> 00:01:44,320
for low poly as well who knows so with

66
00:01:44,320 --> 00:01:47,680
that said let's get started

67
00:01:48,960 --> 00:01:51,280
go yes and we're off tab into edit mode

68
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:52,799
select that face ctrl i

69
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,240
and delete all those faces we'll just

70
00:01:54,240 --> 00:01:56,640
keep the top one ctrl snap it down

71
00:01:56,640 --> 00:01:59,840
scale 10. ctrl r let's make

72
00:01:59,840 --> 00:02:02,079
19 loop cuts to keep it in sync here

73
00:02:02,079 --> 00:02:03,920
with the grid

74
00:02:03,920 --> 00:02:06,880
then 7 on the keypad top view and then

75
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:09,360
let's select or some road segments here

76
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:12,640
let's just do something like this

77
00:02:12,640 --> 00:02:16,160
and then ctrl i again we want to raise

78
00:02:16,160 --> 00:02:16,640
up

79
00:02:16,640 --> 00:02:18,720
e here to erase the sides a little bit

80
00:02:18,720 --> 00:02:20,160
ctrl i to invert

81
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:23,520
ctrl minus make it dark like tarmac

82
00:02:23,520 --> 00:02:27,360
or asphalt i to inset it insert again

83
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:30,400
ctrl plus to expand selection b and hold

84
00:02:30,400 --> 00:02:32,080
the shift key and deselect

85
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,920
the tarmac node so we just get the road

86
00:02:33,920 --> 00:02:35,519
markings g on the left side and make

87
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:35,840
those

88
00:02:35,840 --> 00:02:39,040
white then do box select let's make

89
00:02:39,040 --> 00:02:41,599
something here for uh it could be like a

90
00:02:41,599 --> 00:02:42,319
building there

91
00:02:42,319 --> 00:02:44,640
maybe a car wash here could be maybe a

92
00:02:44,640 --> 00:02:46,080
diner

93
00:02:46,080 --> 00:02:48,959
and some other building maybe a post

94
00:02:48,959 --> 00:02:50,480
office or something here

95
00:02:50,480 --> 00:02:52,720
and here could be another building

96
00:02:52,720 --> 00:02:53,760
whatever sort

97
00:02:53,760 --> 00:02:56,959
and maybe a little shed there or

98
00:02:56,959 --> 00:02:57,519
something

99
00:02:57,519 --> 00:03:00,640
in a town i don't know e to extrude

100
00:03:00,640 --> 00:03:02,879
two units and then now i'm actually

101
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:03,680
gonna

102
00:03:03,680 --> 00:03:06,480
a period individual origin scale and

103
00:03:06,480 --> 00:03:07,840
make some rooftop things

104
00:03:07,840 --> 00:03:11,040
e to extrude eye to inset

105
00:03:11,040 --> 00:03:13,200
eat extrude again now i'm gonna control

106
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:14,640
plus a whole bunch of time let's make

107
00:03:14,640 --> 00:03:16,480
these white so they pop out a little bit

108
00:03:16,480 --> 00:03:19,599
control minus and just select this top

109
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:20,879
and make that really dark

110
00:03:20,879 --> 00:03:23,840
to make a lot of contrast in the picture

111
00:03:23,840 --> 00:03:25,760
now i could do

112
00:03:25,760 --> 00:03:27,040
for this one i actually want to make it

113
00:03:27,040 --> 00:03:28,080
a little bit different this is going to

114
00:03:28,080 --> 00:03:29,360
be a skyscraper

115
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,200
thing but i can still keep it maybe like

116
00:03:31,200 --> 00:03:33,840
that so i'll e to extrude that one

117
00:03:33,840 --> 00:03:35,360
up a bit it's not going to be a

118
00:03:35,360 --> 00:03:37,280
skyscraper but a taller building anyway

119
00:03:37,280 --> 00:03:39,599
or part of it maybe

120
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:42,560
so i'll select that one control plus out

121
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:43,680
to make that a little bit different so

122
00:03:43,680 --> 00:03:45,040
it doesn't look like the

123
00:03:45,040 --> 00:03:47,440
same roof as the others maybe like this

124
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:49,040
and then make it a little bit brighter

125
00:03:49,040 --> 00:03:52,159
like that okay so pardon me this is

126
00:03:52,159 --> 00:03:53,680
gonna be a diner of some sort

127
00:03:53,680 --> 00:03:55,840
maybe i'll hold the alt key ring

128
00:03:55,840 --> 00:03:56,799
selector on

129
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:58,480
or loop select that's gonna be the

130
00:03:58,480 --> 00:04:00,640
entrance control r a few times first

131
00:04:00,640 --> 00:04:02,560
actually i don't wanna

132
00:04:02,560 --> 00:04:04,720
make smaller windows so deselect those

133
00:04:04,720 --> 00:04:07,280
to i to inset twice to get individual

134
00:04:07,280 --> 00:04:10,000
windows alt d to extrude long face

135
00:04:10,000 --> 00:04:10,640
normals

136
00:04:10,640 --> 00:04:13,599
just a little bit make blue windows here

137
00:04:13,599 --> 00:04:15,280
we'll make an entrance so i'll do

138
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:18,400
i to inset at press twice scale

139
00:04:18,400 --> 00:04:21,680
x e to extrude it in

140
00:04:21,680 --> 00:04:24,720
and itunes set that one control plus

141
00:04:24,720 --> 00:04:26,240
first to make it dark

142
00:04:26,240 --> 00:04:28,400
control minus on the keypad and make a

143
00:04:28,400 --> 00:04:30,000
glass door there as well

144
00:04:30,000 --> 00:04:32,080
and here we could make one of those uh

145
00:04:32,080 --> 00:04:33,759
what do you call those uh things that

146
00:04:33,759 --> 00:04:34,080
are

147
00:04:34,080 --> 00:04:36,160
on top of things it's like a marquee

148
00:04:36,160 --> 00:04:37,199
thing

149
00:04:37,199 --> 00:04:39,520
e to extrude like shift d to duplicate

150
00:04:39,520 --> 00:04:40,560
that face first

151
00:04:40,560 --> 00:04:44,000
e to extrude e to extrude again

152
00:04:44,000 --> 00:04:46,240
move that face down ctrl r let's do

153
00:04:46,240 --> 00:04:48,880
eight cuts so we hopefully get

154
00:04:48,880 --> 00:04:51,600
an uneven amount here or is it even i

155
00:04:51,600 --> 00:04:53,040
don't know

156
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:55,120
shift alt click select to loop select

157
00:04:55,120 --> 00:04:56,800
those shift select those

158
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:59,680
and shift select those and then do g and

159
00:04:59,680 --> 00:05:01,120
make those red

160
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:03,680
a bit diner-like maybe i'll select a few

161
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:04,880
things on the roofs here as well that

162
00:05:04,880 --> 00:05:05,280
could be

163
00:05:05,280 --> 00:05:08,639
maybe some coolant things or fans or ac

164
00:05:08,639 --> 00:05:09,199
it's called

165
00:05:09,199 --> 00:05:12,479
air condition i need to extrude

166
00:05:12,479 --> 00:05:15,039
items that beat extruder and control

167
00:05:15,039 --> 00:05:15,520
plus

168
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,120
maybe they look a little bit too uniform

169
00:05:17,120 --> 00:05:18,880
but i'll have to be okay with that

170
00:05:18,880 --> 00:05:20,800
okay the post office maybe that they

171
00:05:20,800 --> 00:05:22,880
can't afford as nice windows

172
00:05:22,880 --> 00:05:26,240
so let's do ctrl r first

173
00:05:26,240 --> 00:05:29,199
actually i keep forgetting

174
00:05:29,280 --> 00:05:31,680
and then shift d select those i to

175
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,600
insert twice

176
00:05:33,600 --> 00:05:36,720
alt d to extrude along base normals

177
00:05:36,720 --> 00:05:39,759
and g also blue windows and here

178
00:05:39,759 --> 00:05:41,199
maybe they've got some fancier windows

179
00:05:41,199 --> 00:05:43,520
here whatever this building is

180
00:05:43,520 --> 00:05:46,400
so they've got corner windows hey fancy

181
00:05:46,400 --> 00:05:47,039
so i

182
00:05:47,039 --> 00:05:52,400
twice alt to extrude long face normals

183
00:05:52,400 --> 00:05:55,520
and blue as well okay here's going to be

184
00:05:55,520 --> 00:05:56,479
the car wash

185
00:05:56,479 --> 00:05:59,440
so i to inset that one and bring it down

186
00:05:59,440 --> 00:06:01,039
so the cars can actually get in

187
00:06:01,039 --> 00:06:04,800
e to extrude inwards here i'll do

188
00:06:04,800 --> 00:06:08,319
let's make that dark in there so g

189
00:06:08,319 --> 00:06:11,840
move there here shift d scale it down

190
00:06:11,840 --> 00:06:14,560
and then right click and subdivide that

191
00:06:14,560 --> 00:06:14,960
one

192
00:06:14,960 --> 00:06:17,600
and then do f3 circle that's the loop

193
00:06:17,600 --> 00:06:18,560
tool add-on

194
00:06:18,560 --> 00:06:22,000
e to extrude and then l to select link

195
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:22,720
then make a

196
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:25,840
red brush thing can a car even fit there

197
00:06:25,840 --> 00:06:27,840
scale shift y make it a little bit

198
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:29,440
smaller like this

199
00:06:29,440 --> 00:06:32,000
that should do okay here maybe a back

200
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:33,680
door here

201
00:06:33,680 --> 00:06:35,520
not in like an i.t security type of

202
00:06:35,520 --> 00:06:37,840
backdoor just a literal backdoor

203
00:06:37,840 --> 00:06:41,120
maybe brown here could be also some

204
00:06:41,120 --> 00:06:44,080
shed maybe not shed why would there be a

205
00:06:44,080 --> 00:06:46,000
shed in here

206
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:48,759
that could be a window okay let's make a

207
00:06:48,759 --> 00:06:50,000
dumpster

208
00:06:50,000 --> 00:06:53,520
back here shifty scale

209
00:06:53,520 --> 00:06:56,880
y move it e to extrude

210
00:06:56,880 --> 00:07:00,560
he took street again scale e to extrude

211
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:03,120
what does the dumpster look like maybe

212
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,120
like this will do

213
00:07:05,120 --> 00:07:07,360
i'll l to select the length g it has to

214
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:08,639
be green i guess

215
00:07:08,639 --> 00:07:10,720
i to inset let's make an open one e to

216
00:07:10,720 --> 00:07:14,000
extrude and move that one down to there

217
00:07:14,000 --> 00:07:16,479
make it dark there okay so we've got a

218
00:07:16,479 --> 00:07:17,599
door here for the

219
00:07:17,599 --> 00:07:22,160
post office item set e to extrude

220
00:07:22,160 --> 00:07:24,000
maybe it'll do a little bit darker there

221
00:07:24,000 --> 00:07:25,199
but they've only got one

222
00:07:25,199 --> 00:07:27,440
actual door here height instead that one

223
00:07:27,440 --> 00:07:28,479
need to extrude

224
00:07:28,479 --> 00:07:30,639
but it's gonna be glass as well maybe

225
00:07:30,639 --> 00:07:31,759
we'll make a little

226
00:07:31,759 --> 00:07:34,639
roof sticking out here height and set e

227
00:07:34,639 --> 00:07:35,840
to extrude

228
00:07:35,840 --> 00:07:38,800
move it down maybe control plus maybe it

229
00:07:38,800 --> 00:07:41,120
could be orange

230
00:07:41,120 --> 00:07:43,199
so we've got the car wash there maybe

231
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:44,240
that could have some

232
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,440
utility boxes here

233
00:07:47,440 --> 00:07:50,720
so python set that one need to extrude

234
00:07:50,720 --> 00:07:52,720
control plus let's make that great some

235
00:07:52,720 --> 00:07:54,000
water pipes and things

236
00:07:54,000 --> 00:07:56,400
okay we have uh 354 okay i have to do

237
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:57,520
something here as well

238
00:07:57,520 --> 00:07:59,599
so this is going to be the entrance for

239
00:07:59,599 --> 00:08:01,039
this one item set

240
00:08:01,039 --> 00:08:03,520
e to extrude item set that goes in a

241
00:08:03,520 --> 00:08:05,599
little bit fancy entrance ctrl r

242
00:08:05,599 --> 00:08:08,720
alt select these i to select i to insert

243
00:08:08,720 --> 00:08:10,800
twice

244
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:14,000
to get individual and now they can be

245
00:08:14,000 --> 00:08:16,879
blue as well so that's going to be okay

246
00:08:16,879 --> 00:08:18,080
we have to have something down here as

247
00:08:18,080 --> 00:08:19,039
well

248
00:08:19,039 --> 00:08:23,199
item set to make

249
00:08:23,199 --> 00:08:25,919
uh let's see alt e to extreme long face

250
00:08:25,919 --> 00:08:27,120
normals that could be

251
00:08:27,120 --> 00:08:30,960
something down there i'll select these

252
00:08:30,960 --> 00:08:33,919
items set these twice i'm not sure what

253
00:08:33,919 --> 00:08:34,959
these look like

254
00:08:34,959 --> 00:08:39,519
alt-d to extrude that's it

255
00:08:39,519 --> 00:08:42,560
okay and uh three minutes okay let's put

256
00:08:42,560 --> 00:08:43,279
a little uh

257
00:08:43,279 --> 00:08:46,320
maybe a flower bed or a grass well just

258
00:08:46,320 --> 00:08:48,000
something with some grass in here

259
00:08:48,000 --> 00:08:50,880
i think set twice e to extrude make it

260
00:08:50,880 --> 00:08:51,440
brown

261
00:08:51,440 --> 00:08:55,279
like dirt height inset e to extrude

262
00:08:55,279 --> 00:08:57,519
control plus make it green just and here

263
00:08:57,519 --> 00:08:58,959
it could be a fountain they've wasted

264
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:00,000
the the postal

265
00:09:00,000 --> 00:09:03,839
stamp money here now on the

266
00:09:03,839 --> 00:09:05,279
little fancy stuff in front of their

267
00:09:05,279 --> 00:09:07,279
building e to extrude item set

268
00:09:07,279 --> 00:09:10,399
et extrude that could be like a little

269
00:09:10,399 --> 00:09:13,440
red okay and

270
00:09:13,440 --> 00:09:15,360
that's it here is a back door as well

271
00:09:15,360 --> 00:09:17,360
item set you to extrude

272
00:09:17,360 --> 00:09:19,600
and make a brown one there maybe a bin

273
00:09:19,600 --> 00:09:21,040
here as

274
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:24,399
shift well scale it down make it green

275
00:09:24,399 --> 00:09:28,399
e to extrude s to scale e to extrude

276
00:09:28,399 --> 00:09:30,720
s to extrude that's the scale e to

277
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:31,760
extrude

278
00:09:31,760 --> 00:09:34,080
and then i'll bring that one up too like

279
00:09:34,080 --> 00:09:37,440
that so 2 minutes 15

280
00:09:37,440 --> 00:09:39,200
maybe they can have a wider window here

281
00:09:39,200 --> 00:09:40,560
as well i to inset

282
00:09:40,560 --> 00:09:43,839
scale on the z axis bring it up

283
00:09:43,839 --> 00:09:47,040
alt to extrude long face normals and g

284
00:09:47,040 --> 00:09:49,519
to move it to a blue okay we can put

285
00:09:49,519 --> 00:09:51,279
some text here maybe so

286
00:09:51,279 --> 00:09:53,279
shift right click there shift a let's do

287
00:09:53,279 --> 00:09:54,880
text rotate

288
00:09:54,880 --> 00:09:58,560
x 90. we have to go into the a tab here

289
00:09:58,560 --> 00:10:00,959
and do geometry we have to extrude it

290
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:05,120
yep there and then shift space g

291
00:10:05,120 --> 00:10:08,160
losing my voice again so tab we could

292
00:10:08,160 --> 00:10:09,279
say maybe

293
00:10:09,279 --> 00:10:12,320
car wash and then we have to scale it

294
00:10:12,320 --> 00:10:14,480
down

295
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:20,399
and let me bring it in move it out to

296
00:10:20,399 --> 00:10:22,880
there okay and then shift d to duplicate

297
00:10:22,880 --> 00:10:23,760
that one let's put

298
00:10:23,760 --> 00:10:25,680
uh text here as well they've used the

299
00:10:25,680 --> 00:10:27,360
same sign company apparently

300
00:10:27,360 --> 00:10:30,399
so it's going to look very similar bring

301
00:10:30,399 --> 00:10:30,640
it

302
00:10:30,640 --> 00:10:32,560
up to there but it can't say car wash

303
00:10:32,560 --> 00:10:34,320
there has to say what little diner or

304
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:35,200
something

305
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:38,959
little diner creative name

306
00:10:38,959 --> 00:10:41,600
not one minute to go okay so i have to

307
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:42,880
colorize this maybe it should look a

308
00:10:42,880 --> 00:10:44,079
little bit more interesting right click

309
00:10:44,079 --> 00:10:45,360
can do convert to mesh

310
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:48,399
right click convert to mesh and then we

311
00:10:48,399 --> 00:10:48,959
have to

312
00:10:48,959 --> 00:10:51,760
pick both of these and change their

313
00:10:51,760 --> 00:10:52,800
shading to

314
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,959
the same material here material so we

315
00:10:54,959 --> 00:10:56,880
can colorize them

316
00:10:56,880 --> 00:11:00,720
tab a scale zero on the left here okay

317
00:11:00,720 --> 00:11:02,480
we've got a problem here

318
00:11:02,480 --> 00:11:05,279
so shading come on why didn't it change

319
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,440
the material

320
00:11:07,440 --> 00:11:09,760
here did that one yeah that one worked

321
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:12,839
scale zero on the uvs let's make it

322
00:11:12,839 --> 00:11:15,680
red and again it's literally the same

323
00:11:15,680 --> 00:11:17,680
sign company because this one's red too

324
00:11:17,680 --> 00:11:20,560
so 32 seconds to go let's uh duplicate

325
00:11:20,560 --> 00:11:20,880
this

326
00:11:20,880 --> 00:11:24,079
bin here like shift d

327
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:27,839
they need to be maybe there as well

328
00:11:27,839 --> 00:11:30,000
and they have to have a bin over here

329
00:11:30,000 --> 00:11:30,880
rotate

330
00:11:30,880 --> 00:11:34,320
so a little bit on this slant there okay

331
00:11:34,320 --> 00:11:35,839
and they can have like a little entrance

332
00:11:35,839 --> 00:11:38,160
thing here as well

333
00:11:38,160 --> 00:11:42,320
so 10 seconds to go shift d

334
00:11:42,320 --> 00:11:45,440
move it in scale

335
00:11:45,440 --> 00:11:49,040
scale z e to extrude

336
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,720
l ah that's it okay

337
00:11:52,720 --> 00:11:57,680
the strangest entrance thing ever

338
00:11:57,680 --> 00:11:59,279
okay and we tab and now we have to look

339
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,040
what it looks like in isometric mode as

340
00:12:01,040 --> 00:12:01,440
well

341
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,760
so because this is still perspective but

342
00:12:03,760 --> 00:12:05,360
if i press 5 on the keypad it'll

343
00:12:05,360 --> 00:12:07,839
probably look a bit strange

344
00:12:07,839 --> 00:12:11,200
so but if you've ever seen those pixel

345
00:12:11,200 --> 00:12:11,680
art

346
00:12:11,680 --> 00:12:14,399
things uh i'll minimize the right panel

347
00:12:14,399 --> 00:12:15,440
there

348
00:12:15,440 --> 00:12:17,040
this is usually the perspective that

349
00:12:17,040 --> 00:12:19,120
they'll have on a on the pixel art

350
00:12:19,120 --> 00:12:20,800
what do you think guys does this look

351
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,560
super weird to you

352
00:12:22,560 --> 00:12:24,320
if i go back into perspective mode it

353
00:12:24,320 --> 00:12:26,480
feels a little bit more like it should

354
00:12:26,480 --> 00:12:28,399
and i was thinking this was just the

355
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,240
lower part of the building so i didn't

356
00:12:30,240 --> 00:12:32,880
necessarily go for any details up there

357
00:12:32,880 --> 00:12:34,560
i wanted to frame it something like this

358
00:12:34,560 --> 00:12:35,760
just so you could have something

359
00:12:35,760 --> 00:12:38,399
shooting out of frame a little bit

360
00:12:38,399 --> 00:12:41,519
so i i still prefer it with

361
00:12:41,519 --> 00:12:43,440
real perspective but again i'd love to

362
00:12:43,440 --> 00:12:45,040
hear what your comments are so put in

363
00:12:45,040 --> 00:12:46,639
the comments guys what you prefer do you

364
00:12:46,639 --> 00:12:48,160
like the isometric

365
00:12:48,160 --> 00:12:50,880
non-perspective one or do you like the

366
00:12:50,880 --> 00:12:52,959
perspective view here

367
00:12:52,959 --> 00:12:55,360
so let's see what the comments say

368
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:56,800
nothing groundbreaking in

369
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:59,360
this episode it was uh stuff that you've

370
00:12:59,360 --> 00:13:00,240
seen all along

371
00:13:00,240 --> 00:13:01,680
all the time it's gonna be it's a lot of

372
00:13:01,680 --> 00:13:03,360
e to extrude este scale

373
00:13:03,360 --> 00:13:06,160
eye to inset eye to inset and often i

374
00:13:06,160 --> 00:13:06,959
press twice

375
00:13:06,959 --> 00:13:08,959
on i to get the individual in setting

376
00:13:08,959 --> 00:13:10,720
and then alt e to extrude along the

377
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,560
normals in words to get the windows

378
00:13:12,560 --> 00:13:14,480
so what should the tip be then something

379
00:13:14,480 --> 00:13:15,920
that i made a little bit different even

380
00:13:15,920 --> 00:13:17,440
if it's not that groundbreaking and you

381
00:13:17,440 --> 00:13:19,040
might not already know this but this is

382
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:20,000
the first time i've used

383
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:22,560
text in one of my scenes and to use text

384
00:13:22,560 --> 00:13:23,839
i did the

385
00:13:23,839 --> 00:13:26,959
shift right click to place my 3d cursor

386
00:13:26,959 --> 00:13:29,680
and then i did shift a and then i added

387
00:13:29,680 --> 00:13:31,279
text

388
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:33,519
and it's a bit strange and maybe you

389
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:35,040
don't really know how to edit this text

390
00:13:35,040 --> 00:13:36,560
because i would have maybe expected it

391
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,120
to be

392
00:13:37,120 --> 00:13:38,720
like a text input field here on the

393
00:13:38,720 --> 00:13:40,480
right when you have this text

394
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
one so the object data properties here

395
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:43,839
selected

396
00:13:43,839 --> 00:13:45,760
but the way to edit the text is actually

397
00:13:45,760 --> 00:13:47,440
the same way you edit objects so you

398
00:13:47,440 --> 00:13:49,120
press tab on the object

399
00:13:49,120 --> 00:13:50,639
and you get a little cursor here so

400
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,000
maybe that's a little bit confusing but

401
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:53,760
then you can delete the text

402
00:13:53,760 --> 00:13:57,839
and put low poly here

403
00:13:57,839 --> 00:13:59,760
and now it's a bit hidden so i'll tap

404
00:13:59,760 --> 00:14:00,959
out of edit mode and then

405
00:14:00,959 --> 00:14:03,360
see there and by default this one is

406
00:14:03,360 --> 00:14:05,040
really really flat

407
00:14:05,040 --> 00:14:08,079
so there's also here you can go into

408
00:14:08,079 --> 00:14:10,560
like i did in the video let's see where

409
00:14:10,560 --> 00:14:11,680
was it

410
00:14:11,680 --> 00:14:14,160
geometry and then you can just slide

411
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:15,920
this extrusion one up here and that'll

412
00:14:15,920 --> 00:14:16,399
make it

413
00:14:16,399 --> 00:14:19,680
thick to be a 3d object and then

414
00:14:19,680 --> 00:14:22,079
this is actually a some sort of a text

415
00:14:22,079 --> 00:14:23,120
shape now

416
00:14:23,120 --> 00:14:25,199
so it's not a real mesh so you can't

417
00:14:25,199 --> 00:14:27,120
press tab into edit mode to edit

418
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,560
geometry or

419
00:14:28,560 --> 00:14:30,720
things like that so what you have to do

420
00:14:30,720 --> 00:14:32,800
because if you press tab

421
00:14:32,800 --> 00:14:35,279
you get to type in the text here so what

422
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,040
i did then was i right clicked on it

423
00:14:37,040 --> 00:14:40,399
and it did convert to mesh and now if i

424
00:14:40,399 --> 00:14:41,040
press tab

425
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:43,600
then i actually see the the polygons so

426
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,839
it becomes a 3d object then

427
00:14:45,839 --> 00:14:47,040
so that's going to be the tip for this

428
00:14:47,040 --> 00:14:49,040
week if you haven't used text before and

429
00:14:49,040 --> 00:14:50,399
if you haven't made it

430
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:52,480
automatically extruded and if you wanted

431
00:14:52,480 --> 00:14:53,839
to convert it to

432
00:14:53,839 --> 00:14:55,519
mesh in the end that's how you do that

433
00:14:55,519 --> 00:14:56,880
all right guys this is going to be it

434
00:14:56,880 --> 00:14:58,399
for this week i hope you enjoyed this

435
00:14:58,399 --> 00:15:00,320
episode as well and a lot of low poly

436
00:15:00,320 --> 00:15:01,279
stuff as usual

437
00:15:01,279 --> 00:15:02,560

440
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:08,079
default cube at the moment and then i've

441
00:15:08,079 --> 00:15:09,760
also got a link to my patreon site there

442
00:15:09,760 --> 00:15:11,120
