00:00:00,040 --> 00:00:02,760
hello everyone and welcome to episode

2
00:00:02,760 --> 00:00:05,960
134 of the 10-minute Ming challenge this

3
00:00:05,960 --> 00:00:07,560
week we're going to be going back to the

4
00:00:07,560 --> 00:00:08,920
roots of the 10-minute modeling

5
00:00:08,920 --> 00:00:10,280
Challenge and I'm going to be doing

6
00:00:10,280 --> 00:00:12,360
something pretty simple I'm going to do

7
00:00:12,360 --> 00:00:13,960
box modeling from scratch and I'm going

8
00:00:13,960 --> 00:00:16,240
to slap a bridge into the game of unfair

9
00:00:16,240 --> 00:00:18,680
Rampage Nightfall which I made and it's

10
00:00:18,680 --> 00:00:20,640
currently on Steam nextfest so if you

11
00:00:20,640 --> 00:00:22,359
haven't checked out the free demo make

12
00:00:22,359 --> 00:00:24,000
sure to head over there and have a look

13
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,800
at it and download it and give it a play

14
00:00:25,800 --> 00:00:27,240
I'll keep it up online as well for a

15
00:00:27,240 --> 00:00:29,039
couple of weeks after steam next Fest

16
00:00:29,039 --> 00:00:31,199
ends cuz there's a lot of games going on

17
00:00:31,199 --> 00:00:33,079
right there and speaking of that I'm

18
00:00:33,079 --> 00:00:35,120
going to start this uh like Intro by

19
00:00:35,120 --> 00:00:37,640
just having a look at Steam nextfest and

20
00:00:37,640 --> 00:00:39,079
just I'll probably fast forward it

21
00:00:39,079 --> 00:00:40,039
because I'm going to see how long it

22
00:00:40,039 --> 00:00:42,480
takes until I find my game in the list

23
00:00:42,480 --> 00:00:44,719
of games there I've gone as Incognito

24
00:00:44,719 --> 00:00:46,520
here under stealth stealth mode like

25
00:00:46,520 --> 00:00:49,920
James Bond but without just like a o z

26
00:00:49,920 --> 00:00:51,879
um that's without the seven I guess

27
00:00:51,879 --> 00:00:53,079
they've changed it this year they don't

28
00:00:53,079 --> 00:00:54,719
do the live stream slots like they did

29
00:00:54,719 --> 00:00:57,600
previous years and I'm a bit un unhappy

30
00:00:57,600 --> 00:00:58,920
about that because it was really good

31
00:00:58,920 --> 00:01:01,399
when we did line War and um we had steam

32
00:01:01,399 --> 00:01:04,159
nextfest when you had your live stream

33
00:01:04,159 --> 00:01:06,640
slot we I think we had over a thousand

34
00:01:06,640 --> 00:01:08,400
people coming to the stam page right

35
00:01:08,400 --> 00:01:09,920
then so it's was a little bit sad to

36
00:01:09,920 --> 00:01:12,280
hear that this month or this time around

37
00:01:12,280 --> 00:01:14,040
on this next Fest they've like they

38
00:01:14,040 --> 00:01:15,880
dropped their focus on that one and it's

39
00:01:15,880 --> 00:01:18,240
over 3,000 games participating in Steam

40
00:01:18,240 --> 00:01:20,079
nextfest so I have a feeling that it's

41
00:01:20,079 --> 00:01:22,079
going to be very difficult to attract

42
00:01:22,079 --> 00:01:24,079
any attention this year but we'll uh

43
00:01:24,079 --> 00:01:25,520
we'll have a look at it and maybe learn

44
00:01:25,520 --> 00:01:27,680
a few things from it anyway and I'm also

45
00:01:27,680 --> 00:01:29,560
discovering that I'm I'm finding quite a

46
00:01:29,560 --> 00:01:31,159
lot of cool games that are coming out so

47
00:01:31,159 --> 00:01:32,680
I'm actually going to do a little video

48
00:01:32,680 --> 00:01:34,240
maybe where I play test some of those

49
00:01:34,240 --> 00:01:36,200
demos that should be fun but I'm going

50
00:01:36,200 --> 00:01:38,960
to look here now steam power.com SL sale

51
00:01:38,960 --> 00:01:42,040
SL nextfest home and I'm just going to

52
00:01:42,040 --> 00:01:43,360
like press play and then I'm just going

53
00:01:43,360 --> 00:01:46,119
to skim through as under stealth mode

54
00:01:46,119 --> 00:01:51,280
here let's see how many we go one 2 3 4

55
00:01:51,280 --> 00:01:54,280
5

56
00:01:59,960 --> 00:02:02,960
I'm

57
00:02:59,239 --> 00:03:07,120
1,1 1 102 13 104 low poly

58
00:03:07,120 --> 00:03:09,440
cool

59
00:03:09,440 --> 00:03:18,879
95 906 97 908 909 9,10 91

60
00:03:18,879 --> 00:03:21,920
92 93

61
00:03:21,920 --> 00:03:24,319
94 9

62
00:03:24,319 --> 00:03:27,439
1,4 I got

63
00:03:27,439 --> 00:03:30,280
it okay 94

64
00:03:30,280 --> 00:03:33,120
no 1,4 I can't can't even count I I know

65
00:03:33,120 --> 00:03:34,720
there are over 3,000 games so I'm

66
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,360
guessing I'm pretty lucky anyway that

67
00:03:36,360 --> 00:03:38,720
I'm in like in the first about 1,000 so

68
00:03:38,720 --> 00:03:41,840
I'm not expecting a massive like flood

69
00:03:41,840 --> 00:03:43,360
like the flood gates are not going to

70
00:03:43,360 --> 00:03:45,920
open to come to see my game and I don't

71
00:03:45,920 --> 00:03:47,439
even know if anyone will notice it to be

72
00:03:47,439 --> 00:03:49,480
honest but it's going to be an an

73
00:03:49,480 --> 00:03:51,439
important journey to see the wish list

74
00:03:51,439 --> 00:03:53,079
I've picked up a little bit maybe I'm

75
00:03:53,079 --> 00:03:55,760
getting like 60 or 70 a day now and it's

76
00:03:55,760 --> 00:03:57,640
a long way to 10,000 wish lists but I'm

77
00:03:57,640 --> 00:03:59,400
going to I'm going to have to do some

78
00:03:59,400 --> 00:04:01,680
tradition marketing as well J in my

79
00:04:01,680 --> 00:04:03,720
Discord is uh telling me as well that I

80
00:04:03,720 --> 00:04:05,480
need to do traditional marketing too

81
00:04:05,480 --> 00:04:06,840
which of course I have to do so I have

82
00:04:06,840 --> 00:04:08,599
to figure out some way reach out to some

83
00:04:08,599 --> 00:04:10,720
other YouTubers and get some streamers

84
00:04:10,720 --> 00:04:12,519
doing it and look at other ways to

85
00:04:12,519 --> 00:04:13,959
advertise it maybe I have to be a little

86
00:04:13,959 --> 00:04:15,519
bit active in different forums and stuff

87
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,840
but it's a tricky balance not to spam

88
00:04:17,840 --> 00:04:20,280
but to like to spread your word uh so

89
00:04:20,280 --> 00:04:21,759
we'll we'll see how it goes I'm sure

90
00:04:21,759 --> 00:04:24,120
it'll be all right like this game a few

91
00:04:24,120 --> 00:04:25,800
Reflections that I did there's a lot of

92
00:04:25,800 --> 00:04:27,240
games that are coming out of course and

93
00:04:27,240 --> 00:04:29,400
a lot of them look are look pretty nice

94
00:04:29,400 --> 00:04:30,919
there were a few of them that really

95
00:04:30,919 --> 00:04:32,199
caught my eyes that I've actually got to

96
00:04:32,199 --> 00:04:33,720
check out I'm going to look through my

97
00:04:33,720 --> 00:04:35,160
recording and see cuz there was like

98
00:04:35,160 --> 00:04:36,759
three or four or five games there like I

99
00:04:36,759 --> 00:04:38,759

111
00:05:17,560 --> 00:05:21,560
358 that looks cool ooh I have to

112
00:05:21,560 --> 00:05:27,600
remember that one 358 359 445 446 447

113
00:05:27,600 --> 00:05:30,520

114

115
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:39,600
448 467 468 low poly 469 cool skiing oh

117
00:05:48,840 --> 00:05:53,560

118
00:05:53,560 --> 00:05:57,479
that 675 6794

119
00:05:57,479 --> 00:06:00,960
695 nice as well ooh

120
00:06:00,960 --> 00:06:04,240
nice 696 69

121
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,280
809 this is cool I'm going to make a

122
00:06:06,280 --> 00:06:09,240
game like this I love it I have to check

123
00:06:09,240 --> 00:06:13,960
that one 789 7 so and another reflection

124
00:06:13,960 --> 00:06:15,800
I did that there was a lot of low poly a

125
00:06:15,800 --> 00:06:17,840
lot of col for low poly stuff kind of

126
00:06:17,840 --> 00:06:20,080
cool to see and uh I'm I don't know

127
00:06:20,080 --> 00:06:22,000
maybe not so good for me because it

128
00:06:22,000 --> 00:06:23,840
it'll like melt in my low poly style

129
00:06:23,840 --> 00:06:25,199
will start blending in with everything

130
00:06:25,199 --> 00:06:27,280
else so I mean but it's kind of cool to

131
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:29,120
see that it's uh like it's on a on a

132
00:06:29,120 --> 00:06:31,360
good pop rise another reflection I did

133
00:06:31,360 --> 00:06:33,199
was that there was a lot of Nic looking

134
00:06:33,199 --> 00:06:35,759
games a lot of quirky ones and a lot of

135
00:06:35,759 --> 00:06:37,599
fun stuff and it's fun to see Indies

136
00:06:37,599 --> 00:06:39,639
being able to really like go at it and

137
00:06:39,639 --> 00:06:41,000
just create whatever they want without

138
00:06:41,000 --> 00:06:42,880
the pressure of a publisher to shove it

139
00:06:42,880 --> 00:06:44,960
down their throat what they want them to

140
00:06:44,960 --> 00:06:46,840
publish what could be making money so a

141
00:06:46,840 --> 00:06:48,639
lot of weird little quirky games are

142
00:06:48,639 --> 00:06:50,680
coming out which is cool I also saw a

143
00:06:50,680 --> 00:06:52,720
bunch of horror games and I think that's

144
00:06:52,720 --> 00:06:55,080
because um about a year and a year and a

145
00:06:55,080 --> 00:06:57,199
half and two years ago there was like a

146
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,039
gap in the market and we had all the

147
00:06:59,039 --> 00:07:00,960
piggy things and Five Nights at Freddy's

148
00:07:00,960 --> 00:07:02,639
and stuff so I think all of those games

149
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,919
are starting to hit the market now so

150
00:07:03,919 --> 00:07:05,280
it's probably going to flood the market

151
00:07:05,280 --> 00:07:07,360
with with horror games instead and I

152
00:07:07,360 --> 00:07:09,080
horror games never been my thing I don't

153
00:07:09,080 --> 00:07:10,879
like anything horror stuff so I'll just

154
00:07:10,879 --> 00:07:13,960
stick to like action or Adventure or a

155
00:07:13,960 --> 00:07:15,680
combination of the two so should be kind

156
00:07:15,680 --> 00:07:17,639
of cool in my last video I showed the

157
00:07:17,639 --> 00:07:19,240
little Pac-Man ghosts that my daughter

158
00:07:19,240 --> 00:07:21,599
had uh been crocheting and she's been

159
00:07:21,599 --> 00:07:24,080
added again first she made this one and

160
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:25,680
it's so

161
00:07:25,680 --> 00:07:28,400
fluffy she made this one it's a it's a

162
00:07:28,400 --> 00:07:31,280
little cow and it's super super smooth

163
00:07:31,280 --> 00:07:33,120
it's like the the yarn that she's used

164
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:36,400
is like so nice and fluffy so and she's

165
00:07:36,400 --> 00:07:37,879
going to open up a little business and

166
00:07:37,879 --> 00:07:39,800
sell these in some local markets and see

167
00:07:39,800 --> 00:07:41,759
how that goes and I think we're even

168
00:07:41,759 --> 00:07:43,560
going to look at uh setting something up

169
00:07:43,560 --> 00:07:45,240
online for her so maybe we can auction a

170
00:07:45,240 --> 00:07:48,039
few these off or something and jzilla is

171
00:07:48,039 --> 00:07:50,560
already like expressed her interest to

172
00:07:50,560 --> 00:07:52,479
get this one so we U we're working

173
00:07:52,479 --> 00:07:54,039
things out there and today she made this

174
00:07:54,039 --> 00:07:56,240
one took 7 hours it's a little ballerina

175
00:07:56,240 --> 00:07:58,400
with a little uh like little skirt on

176
00:07:58,400 --> 00:07:59,840
and everything and she's really

177
00:07:59,840 --> 00:08:01,599
progressed she started earlier this year

178
00:08:01,599 --> 00:08:03,599
and she's H 10 years old now and she's

179
00:08:03,599 --> 00:08:05,360
crocheting like a little crochet master

180
00:08:05,360 --> 00:08:06,840
so I have to go and buy some more yarn

181
00:08:06,840 --> 00:08:08,080
soon and I think we're also going to

182
00:08:08,080 --> 00:08:09,599
have a challenge where she's going to be

183
00:08:09,599 --> 00:08:10,919
crocheting something and I'm going to be

184
00:08:10,919 --> 00:08:12,440
3D modeling the same thing so we'll

185
00:08:12,440 --> 00:08:13,960
probably put a video up on that in in

186
00:08:13,960 --> 00:08:15,319
the series that should be a lot of fun

187
00:08:15,319 --> 00:08:16,919
as well all right let's head over to

188
00:08:16,919 --> 00:08:19,080
blender now and I've got a little start

189
00:08:19,080 --> 00:08:20,759
scene going here and this is the box

190
00:08:20,759 --> 00:08:22,440
that we're going to be starting from

191
00:08:22,440 --> 00:08:24,000
I've placed two of the stone blocks here

192
00:08:24,000 --> 00:08:26,039
from unfair Rampage and uh they're going

193
00:08:26,039 --> 00:08:28,159
to be acting as a little connector

194
00:08:28,159 --> 00:08:29,720
because I need to build a new bridge

195
00:08:29,720 --> 00:08:31,639
between here this is the bridge that's

196
00:08:31,639 --> 00:08:34,240
already in the game and uh um for every

197
00:08:34,240 --> 00:08:35,760
time you cross a bridge it's the same

198
00:08:35,760 --> 00:08:37,719
Bridge so I really want to model five

199
00:08:37,719 --> 00:08:38,800
different ones cuz there are five

200
00:08:38,800 --> 00:08:40,719
different Bridges to cross and the first

201
00:08:40,719 --> 00:08:42,680
one is like a broken Wood Bridge and the

202
00:08:42,680 --> 00:08:44,039
second thing I'm think I'm going to do

203
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:45,880
some sort of a stone bridge here and see

204
00:08:45,880 --> 00:08:47,480
how that goes and I think after I

205
00:08:47,480 --> 00:08:49,399
modeled it I'll spend a little time to

206
00:08:49,399 --> 00:08:50,920
just Tweaky if anything's broken and

207
00:08:50,920 --> 00:08:52,399
then I'll bring it into the game as well

208
00:08:52,399 --> 00:08:53,720
so we can see that what what that one

209
00:08:53,720 --> 00:08:55,800
looks like so I think that's what we're

210
00:08:55,800 --> 00:08:58,040
going to do I'm going to put my my phone

211
00:08:58,040 --> 00:09:00,360
in aircraft mode CU I'm not going to fly

212
00:09:00,360 --> 00:09:02,800
anywhere but I don't want it to be

213
00:09:02,800 --> 00:09:06,000
going in my speakers or in my microphone

214
00:09:06,000 --> 00:09:08,000
so let's do that first of all batteries

215
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,640
all right clock let's put 10 minutes on

216
00:09:10,640 --> 00:09:14,440
the clock here timer 10 minutes and

217
00:09:14,440 --> 00:09:16,399
we're going to be enabling screencast

218
00:09:16,399 --> 00:09:18,079
Keys we need that so you can see what's

219
00:09:18,079 --> 00:09:21,040
going on and let's resize that a little

220
00:09:21,040 --> 00:09:23,240
bit and let's get started so this is

221
00:09:23,240 --> 00:09:24,880
going to be my reference these are my

222
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:26,519
little anchor points and this is the one

223
00:09:26,519 --> 00:09:27,760
that we're going to be modeling from

224
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:30,720
I've got my pix pal texture see we got

225
00:09:30,720 --> 00:09:33,920
uh proportional smooth blah blah blah

226
00:09:33,920 --> 00:09:37,120
that's all right let's get started

227
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:40,000
ready uh Stone Bridge for unfair Rampage

228
00:09:40,000 --> 00:09:43,160
Nightfall in Ready

229
00:09:43,160 --> 00:09:46,240
Steady go and we're off woo yep all

230
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:49,720
right so Ty ined mode and uh eight

231
00:09:49,720 --> 00:09:52,120
select everything scale s to scale and

232
00:09:52,120 --> 00:09:54,240
scale on the y axis scale on the xaxis

233
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:55,720
I'm going to make it a little bit wider

234
00:09:55,720 --> 00:09:57,680
like that control R Loop cut and we'll

235
00:09:57,680 --> 00:10:00,959
do 20 Loop Cuts ni and round and then

236
00:10:00,959 --> 00:10:02,760
three to face select shift select these

237
00:10:02,760 --> 00:10:04,279
two and then I'm going to do

238
00:10:04,279 --> 00:10:07,240
proportional and then uh I guess I'll do

239
00:10:07,240 --> 00:10:10,079
like an arc like this sharp

240
00:10:10,079 --> 00:10:13,000
gz and then we'll do something like this

241
00:10:13,000 --> 00:10:14,320
don't know why I don't get a perfect

242
00:10:14,320 --> 00:10:16,560
circle here so or like an arch so let's

243
00:10:16,560 --> 00:10:19,600
manually change these as well so I'll go

244
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,839
g z and then just try to tweak it a

245
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:23,680
little bit I don't know it doesn't have

246
00:10:23,680 --> 00:10:25,600
to be perfect that's a good thing this

247
00:10:25,600 --> 00:10:28,720
uh back in these days so scale Zed and

248
00:10:28,720 --> 00:10:30,360
then we'll just flatten this as well and

249
00:10:30,360 --> 00:10:32,040
then El select the link and bring it up

250
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,560
to here something like that will be will

251
00:10:34,560 --> 00:10:38,160
be good I'll select these and uh like

252
00:10:38,160 --> 00:10:40,279
actually I'll shift select these no I'll

253
00:10:40,279 --> 00:10:42,959
I'll control select and then okay to

254
00:10:42,959 --> 00:10:45,560
there e to extrude Middle click to like

255
00:10:45,560 --> 00:10:47,240
snap it on the axis and then bring it

256
00:10:47,240 --> 00:10:50,000
down to there and then scale should I

257
00:10:50,000 --> 00:10:52,800
scale these I'll shift select these and

258
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:53,959
think I'm going to scale this a little

259
00:10:53,959 --> 00:10:55,519
bit on the Y axxis probably better ways

260
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:58,160
to do this but let's go something like

261
00:10:58,160 --> 00:11:00,079
that I don't know

262
00:11:00,079 --> 00:11:01,920
H we'll see how it goes and then I'll

263
00:11:01,920 --> 00:11:03,760
alt select on this edge here cuz that

264
00:11:03,760 --> 00:11:05,279
ring selects everything around shift

265
00:11:05,279 --> 00:11:07,040
select shift select these and ALT e to

266
00:11:07,040 --> 00:11:08,760
extrude long face normals and just get a

267
00:11:08,760 --> 00:11:10,800
little like I don't know something

268
00:11:10,800 --> 00:11:12,079
something there a little something

269
00:11:12,079 --> 00:11:14,440
something and I've got an itchy nose bad

270
00:11:14,440 --> 00:11:15,760
timing

271
00:11:15,760 --> 00:11:18,760
8:30 all right so it's I think it's

272
00:11:18,760 --> 00:11:21,079
actually L select link scale Zed let's

273
00:11:21,079 --> 00:11:22,399
flatten this whole thing out a little

274
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,800
bit like this and also I'm going to do

275
00:11:24,800 --> 00:11:26,560
some foundations here or something I

276
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:29,399
don't know I'm I'm not going to like pay

277
00:11:29,399 --> 00:11:31,480
like too much I'll just do it's actually

278
00:11:31,480 --> 00:11:33,639
better if it's a bit irregular on both

279
00:11:33,639 --> 00:11:35,360
sides so it like looks a bit different

280
00:11:35,360 --> 00:11:37,320
so I'll just do e to extrude S to scale

281
00:11:37,320 --> 00:11:40,200
it down there a bit and then uh I think

282
00:11:40,200 --> 00:11:43,440
e to extrude uh I'll move this scale on

283
00:11:43,440 --> 00:11:45,279
the Y AIS or something cuz these are

284
00:11:45,279 --> 00:11:46,639
going to be disappearing down into

285
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:48,399
foreverness so I'm not too bothered

286
00:11:48,399 --> 00:11:50,800
about these things and uh I'll do the

287
00:11:50,800 --> 00:11:52,320
same I'll actually do Shifty to

288
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,399
duplicate it scale on the Y

289
00:11:55,399 --> 00:11:57,560
axis1 and we'll move it here and I think

290
00:11:57,560 --> 00:12:00,000
I need to do uh let's see back face

291
00:12:00,000 --> 00:12:01,440
calling I currently see in this view so

292
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:03,600
alt and recalculate outside just in case

293
00:12:03,600 --> 00:12:06,079
there those are inverted and let's put

294
00:12:06,079 --> 00:12:07,760
some weird Stones here as well I'm going

295
00:12:07,760 --> 00:12:09,399
to be make this a bit wonky so it

296
00:12:09,399 --> 00:12:11,720
doesn't look so like perfect it's not

297
00:12:11,720 --> 00:12:14,279
perfect but I'm going to do like

298
00:12:14,279 --> 00:12:15,600
something like I'll put some stone

299
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,079
blocks here how we doing

300
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,639
739 so I'm just going to go e to extrude

301
00:12:20,639 --> 00:12:22,199
it's actually better the the worse it

302
00:12:22,199 --> 00:12:24,680
looks the better it is cuz it's like a

303
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:26,639
like they they like they just took stone

304
00:12:26,639 --> 00:12:28,279
blocks back in the day didn't they so

305
00:12:28,279 --> 00:12:29,839
and did what they could with it

306
00:12:29,839 --> 00:12:31,760
so I think I'm going to do actually I'm

307
00:12:31,760 --> 00:12:34,279
going to still have a little Arc maybe

308
00:12:34,279 --> 00:12:37,240
gz and bring this okay and I think I'm

309
00:12:37,240 --> 00:12:39,880
going to do this one now smooth

310
00:12:39,880 --> 00:12:41,680
something like that I don't know doesn't

311
00:12:41,680 --> 00:12:44,720
really matter too much uh so why am I

312
00:12:44,720 --> 00:12:46,440
spending so much time on it then control

313
00:12:46,440 --> 00:12:50,000
R Loop cut scale on the Y AIS okay no o

314
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:53,399
proportional off scale xaxis to here and

315
00:12:53,399 --> 00:12:55,440
then I'm just going to go like control

316
00:12:55,440 --> 00:12:56,920
select there shift select there control

317
00:12:56,920 --> 00:12:58,920
select there e to extrude it a little

318
00:12:58,920 --> 00:13:01,079
bit like this and then I'm going to do

319
00:13:01,079 --> 00:13:02,959
F3 check D select that was already

320
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:05,120
selected cuz I use that one so much and

321
00:13:05,120 --> 00:13:06,519
it actually selected the wrong ones I

322
00:13:06,519 --> 00:13:08,600
wanted make sure this one's active and

323
00:13:08,600 --> 00:13:09,959
then check your deselect okay I want to

324
00:13:09,959 --> 00:13:12,079
make sure apparently this one's active

325
00:13:12,079 --> 00:13:13,800
check your deselect there we go and then

326
00:13:13,800 --> 00:13:15,560
now I'm going to select that that one's

327
00:13:15,560 --> 00:13:18,560
active F3 check your D select and then

328
00:13:18,560 --> 00:13:21,320
we'll do e to extrude these and I wonder

329
00:13:21,320 --> 00:13:24,279
if I can flatten these uh comma or

330
00:13:24,279 --> 00:13:27,760
period individual Origins scale z0 yeah

331
00:13:27,760 --> 00:13:29,440
that's good so I've flattened all those

332
00:13:29,440 --> 00:13:31,680
out a little bit that should do and uh

333
00:13:31,680 --> 00:13:33,800
maybe just for some I don't know some

334
00:13:33,800 --> 00:13:35,399
more I'm only going to be seeing one

335
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:36,600
side actually so I'm not going to spend

336
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:39,000
much time on the backside there at all

337
00:13:39,000 --> 00:13:41,240
and let's get some more stone blocks

338
00:13:41,240 --> 00:13:42,959
here we'll do Shifty to duplicate this

339
00:13:42,959 --> 00:13:45,800
one I just got like a little nice Trio

340
00:13:45,800 --> 00:13:48,320
here of blocks and then let's make

341
00:13:48,320 --> 00:13:50,600
control shift B losing my voice for some

342
00:13:50,600 --> 00:13:53,720
reason why is that happening control b

343
00:13:53,720 --> 00:13:55,480
control no I'm actually doing control

344
00:13:55,480 --> 00:13:58,480
shift B to Bevel up a Vertex that's how

345
00:13:58,480 --> 00:14:00,800
you have to do that on control shift B

346
00:14:00,800 --> 00:14:02,639
just get some control shift B not all of

347
00:14:02,639 --> 00:14:04,519
them but a few of them like that

348
00:14:04,519 --> 00:14:06,920
different sizes GG to slide the vers

349
00:14:06,920 --> 00:14:09,320
here now on these sides here so they're

350
00:14:09,320 --> 00:14:11,160
not like perfectly triangular something

351
00:14:11,160 --> 00:14:14,519
like this maybe that'll do that's my

352
00:14:14,519 --> 00:14:17,199
favorite word in the world that'll do so

353
00:14:17,199 --> 00:14:19,000
there we go change that one a little bit

354
00:14:19,000 --> 00:14:21,120
maybe move this one in and this one

355
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:22,759
we've got three blocks going there so

356
00:14:22,759 --> 00:14:24,600
now I'm going to L to select the link

357
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,519
here and then make sure I'm in side view

358
00:14:26,519 --> 00:14:27,959
and then I'm just going to like shift d

359
00:14:27,959 --> 00:14:29,519
to duplicate these in a few placees

360
00:14:29,519 --> 00:14:31,440
Shifty to duplicate it root okay I'm

361
00:14:31,440 --> 00:14:34,079
going to take individual off so period

362
00:14:34,079 --> 00:14:37,240
median Point rotate okay I'm in perfect

363
00:14:37,240 --> 00:14:39,519
side view here so not going to be too

364
00:14:39,519 --> 00:14:41,839
picky about these things rotate there

365
00:14:41,839 --> 00:14:43,959
and then root shift d to duplicate I'll

366
00:14:43,959 --> 00:14:45,680
make sure I keep that pattern a little

367
00:14:45,680 --> 00:14:48,839
bit Shifty to duplicate and here we're

368
00:14:48,839 --> 00:14:51,839
like a bit going a bit off the thing but

369
00:14:51,839 --> 00:14:54,160
that's okay I think we're fine with that

370
00:14:54,160 --> 00:14:56,040
I'm not going to put them everywhere so

371
00:14:56,040 --> 00:14:58,160
Shifty to duplicate that on Shifty to

372
00:14:58,160 --> 00:15:00,160
duplicate there and then now maybe I'll

373
00:15:00,160 --> 00:15:02,440
just shift select a bunch of these and

374
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:04,120
see if we can just jumble them a little

375
00:15:04,120 --> 00:15:05,720
bit more there must be better ways to

376
00:15:05,720 --> 00:15:08,880
make this random drop the one random

377
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:12,720
down there g z o for proportional and

378
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:16,320
then maybe scale them no G to move it

379
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,320
and I don't know I'll just move a few of

380
00:15:18,320 --> 00:15:20,519
them manually like this just to get a

381
00:15:20,519 --> 00:15:23,519
little bit more irregular stuff G all

382
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:26,000
right so I think we'll oh I not going to

383
00:15:26,000 --> 00:15:28,680
duplicate the ver duplicate that one G

384
00:15:28,680 --> 00:15:30,399
all right so now I think I'm going to do

385
00:15:30,399 --> 00:15:32,360
like a few bevels here as well I'll

386
00:15:32,360 --> 00:15:35,040
select a few of these random control B

387
00:15:35,040 --> 00:15:37,279
not shift B this time because we're

388
00:15:37,279 --> 00:15:39,360
doing uh just bevel on the edges so it's

389
00:15:39,360 --> 00:15:42,079
only vers that you do control shift B

390
00:15:42,079 --> 00:15:45,120
it's control B for like these ones and

391
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:46,639
then maybe I can slide these in I've got

392
00:15:46,639 --> 00:15:48,759
proportional on I don't

393
00:15:48,759 --> 00:15:52,519
care and control I'll just jumble this

394
00:15:52,519 --> 00:15:54,639
up how we doing 352 so time's going

395
00:15:54,639 --> 00:15:57,160
pretty fast I've noticed 10 minutes is

396
00:15:57,160 --> 00:15:59,360
not a long time

397
00:15:59,360 --> 00:16:02,680
in case anyone's not noticed so rotate Z

398
00:16:02,680 --> 00:16:06,440
okay rotate X there we go all right I

399
00:16:06,440 --> 00:16:07,800
should probably jumble a few of these as

400
00:16:07,800 --> 00:16:09,880
well I'll select a few of these and then

401
00:16:09,880 --> 00:16:11,079
I'm actually going to do a few of the

402
00:16:11,079 --> 00:16:12,720
backside as well cuz you might be able

403
00:16:12,720 --> 00:16:15,000
to see a few of those so and a few of

404
00:16:15,000 --> 00:16:18,279
these like randomly select control shift

405
00:16:18,279 --> 00:16:22,440
B to Bevel these ah oh yeah W it's a big

406
00:16:22,440 --> 00:16:25,600
impact there we go that's it so and I'm

407
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:27,240
also going to do something here I think

408
00:16:27,240 --> 00:16:29,120
I've got to do some for form of stone

409
00:16:29,120 --> 00:16:30,120
block to make it a little bit more

410
00:16:30,120 --> 00:16:31,839
interesting here so e to extrude this

411
00:16:31,839 --> 00:16:33,920
one L select the link scale on the y-

412
00:16:33,920 --> 00:16:36,720
axis bring this in here and then we'll

413
00:16:36,720 --> 00:16:40,600
do control shift B to like bevel these

414
00:16:40,600 --> 00:16:43,360
and maybe we'll do should we bevel this

415
00:16:43,360 --> 00:16:45,839
whole thing control control B to Bevel

416
00:16:45,839 --> 00:16:49,079
that whole thing control yeah contrl R I

417
00:16:49,079 --> 00:16:51,399
think I'm going to do actually control R

418
00:16:51,399 --> 00:16:54,759
I can't really do these anymore okay so

419
00:16:54,759 --> 00:16:57,399
we'll just keep it like that then

420
00:16:57,399 --> 00:16:59,560
fine but I'll still like make it a

421
00:16:59,560 --> 00:17:01,519
little bit more irregular like this

422
00:17:01,519 --> 00:17:04,439
there we go and then I'll do Shifty to

423
00:17:04,439 --> 00:17:07,079
duplicate this one and rotate it all the

424
00:17:07,079 --> 00:17:10,600
way around to here and we'll do shift d

425
00:17:10,600 --> 00:17:12,679
to duplicate it down here scale on the Y

426
00:17:12,679 --> 00:17:16,280
AIS G to move it in and rotate it a

427
00:17:16,280 --> 00:17:18,600
little bit so it's off Shifty we've got

428
00:17:18,600 --> 00:17:21,559
2 minutes to go and here we'll do GG

429
00:17:21,559 --> 00:17:23,919
slide that on GG slide that on and then

430
00:17:23,919 --> 00:17:26,720
move that up to there and Shifty to

431
00:17:26,720 --> 00:17:28,919
duplicate this one rotate a little bit

432
00:17:28,919 --> 00:17:31,280
on the Zed the wonkier the better that's

433
00:17:31,280 --> 00:17:34,200
what I say and GG slide this one this

434
00:17:34,200 --> 00:17:36,760
can be very irregular like that grab

435
00:17:36,760 --> 00:17:38,960
this one El select the link Shifty to

436
00:17:38,960 --> 00:17:42,360
duplicate it bring it down scale Zed and

437
00:17:42,360 --> 00:17:47,080
a flat one here and scale y That's fine

438
00:17:47,080 --> 00:17:49,799
Shifty to duplicate that one rotate on

439
00:17:49,799 --> 00:17:53,799
the x- axis and scale it scale Zed again

440
00:17:53,799 --> 00:17:58,039
GG and now let's just mirror these I'm

441
00:17:58,039 --> 00:18:00,480
lo my voice again for some reason shift

442
00:18:00,480 --> 00:18:04,000
e to duplicate this one scale y minus

443
00:18:04,000 --> 00:18:07,840
one and we'll do rotate and then

444
00:18:07,840 --> 00:18:10,559
just jumble these a little bit El select

445
00:18:10,559 --> 00:18:14,440
the link scale scale Y and El select the

446
00:18:14,440 --> 00:18:17,720
link scale y make them a bit wider like

447
00:18:17,720 --> 00:18:20,280
this and I think I need to put more like

448
00:18:20,280 --> 00:18:21,799
blocks here as well we only got one

449
00:18:21,799 --> 00:18:23,159
minute to go so I'll put some wood stuff

450
00:18:23,159 --> 00:18:24,600
on here as well and we'll fix these in a

451
00:18:24,600 --> 00:18:27,039
second so Shifty to duplicate that scale

452
00:18:27,039 --> 00:18:29,400
it down and I'm I'm going to do like a

453
00:18:29,400 --> 00:18:30,799
wood thing here I don't know should it

454
00:18:30,799 --> 00:18:34,039
come out here yeah e l e to well e to

455
00:18:34,039 --> 00:18:36,640
extrude G we'll move this into some dark

456
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:38,679
wood color there and let's just move

457
00:18:38,679 --> 00:18:41,159
this one up to here I don't know these

458
00:18:41,159 --> 00:18:43,120
found these might be a little bit too

459
00:18:43,120 --> 00:18:44,520
big compared to the other bridge I'm

460
00:18:44,520 --> 00:18:46,640
seeing now but never mind who cares

461
00:18:46,640 --> 00:18:48,880
Shifty to duplicate it scale it on the Z

462
00:18:48,880 --> 00:18:52,039
axis scale down move it in maybe to

463
00:18:52,039 --> 00:18:53,840
there and e to extrude it and then

464
00:18:53,840 --> 00:18:55,480
should we do shift e to duplicate it

465
00:18:55,480 --> 00:18:57,600
scale it down scale on the x-axis press

466
00:18:57,600 --> 00:19:00,120
X there scale it up a little bit again e

467
00:19:00,120 --> 00:19:02,400
to extrude and move it into here and how

468
00:19:02,400 --> 00:19:04,159
we doing 42 seconds so I'm just going to

469
00:19:04,159 --> 00:19:07,120
put a few of these here so L select the

470
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:09,720
link three shift d to duplicate them

471
00:19:09,720 --> 00:19:12,280
we'll do maybe every other should we do

472
00:19:12,280 --> 00:19:15,520
that so there shift d to duplicate it

473
00:19:15,520 --> 00:19:18,440
and Shifty hopefully um with it being

474
00:19:18,440 --> 00:19:22,840
even yeah lucky me cuz the number of oh

475
00:19:22,840 --> 00:19:27,320
didn't copy that one so l l 19 seconds

476
00:19:27,320 --> 00:19:29,240
Shifty to duplicate it shift d to

477
00:19:29,240 --> 00:19:31,520
duplicate it shift d to duplicate it

478
00:19:31,520 --> 00:19:34,640
shift d to duplicate it alt G to no I

479
00:19:34,640 --> 00:19:36,120
was just joking shift d to duplicate

480
00:19:36,120 --> 00:19:38,280
that shift d to duplicate it scale it

481
00:19:38,280 --> 00:19:41,440
down bring it down e to extrude and E to

482
00:19:41,440 --> 00:19:44,200
extrude bring it up e to extrude bring

483
00:19:44,200 --> 00:19:47,559
it up e to extrude e to extrude bring it

484
00:19:47,559 --> 00:19:51,720
down um e to extrude and bring it

485
00:19:51,720 --> 00:19:53,760
down there we

486
00:19:53,760 --> 00:19:57,039
go so that's my bridge in 10 minutes

487
00:19:57,039 --> 00:19:58,960
it's got got these I I think I'm going

488
00:19:58,960 --> 00:20:01,280
to mirror these on the other side so we

489
00:20:01,280 --> 00:20:02,919
can officially stop the clock here I

490
00:20:02,919 --> 00:20:04,520
have no idea what this one will look

491
00:20:04,520 --> 00:20:07,000
like in the game yet but it is a

492
00:20:07,000 --> 00:20:08,440
different style from from that Wood

493
00:20:08,440 --> 00:20:10,559
Bridge anyway so I'm going to save this

494
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:13,720
one for now contrl s and then we'll do

495
00:20:13,720 --> 00:20:17,799
F2 we'll call this stone bridge and then

496
00:20:17,799 --> 00:20:19,360
it wouldn't be a true infancia 10-minute

497
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:21,480
Ming challenge unless we just fix it up

498
00:20:21,480 --> 00:20:23,240
a little bit it's a little bit rough

499
00:20:23,240 --> 00:20:24,840
around the edges so let's see what we

500
00:20:24,840 --> 00:20:26,640
can do and uh and tweak it what do we

501
00:20:26,640 --> 00:20:29,000
need to address here I think uh I'm

502
00:20:29,000 --> 00:20:30,520
going to do Shifty to duplicate it cuz

503
00:20:30,520 --> 00:20:33,520
we have the original there and let's see

504
00:20:33,520 --> 00:20:35,559
where where is my Stone Bridge I've got

505
00:20:35,559 --> 00:20:37,360
a lot of aets here from the game there

506
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:39,080
we go so I'm going to hide that one and

507
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:40,840
let's just work a little bit on this one

508
00:20:40,840 --> 00:20:42,159
so the first thing I'm going to do is

509
00:20:42,159 --> 00:20:45,600
I'm going to I think we're a bit too

510
00:20:45,600 --> 00:20:47,240
close to those so I don't want Zed

511
00:20:47,240 --> 00:20:50,280
fighting here uh so I want to make sure

512
00:20:50,280 --> 00:20:52,200
that the polygons are a little bit more

513
00:20:52,200 --> 00:20:53,880
above than like you'd normally so

514
00:20:53,880 --> 00:20:55,480
they're not fighting on the same vertex

515
00:20:55,480 --> 00:20:57,840
space there so I'm going to do extrude

516
00:20:57,840 --> 00:20:59,280
that one a little bit and maybe we'll

517
00:20:59,280 --> 00:21:01,640
extrude this one a little bit to there

518
00:21:01,640 --> 00:21:03,840
and then we'll do I think I'm also going

519
00:21:03,840 --> 00:21:06,480
to do like I I don't like when

520
00:21:06,480 --> 00:21:09,320
everything's perfect

521
00:21:09,320 --> 00:21:11,640
perfect even though I'm a perfectionist

522
00:21:11,640 --> 00:21:14,440
I don't like it control R I used to be a

523
00:21:14,440 --> 00:21:17,720
perfectionist now I'm not anymore uh so

524
00:21:17,720 --> 00:21:19,640
G because when everything's like super

525
00:21:19,640 --> 00:21:21,159
aligned and super perfect it looks a bit

526
00:21:21,159 --> 00:21:24,159
boring so I'm just control R doing

527
00:21:24,159 --> 00:21:26,559
some stuff here and then scaling it

528
00:21:26,559 --> 00:21:29,279
maybe control R here

529
00:21:29,279 --> 00:21:33,080
this one scale it down G to move it and

530
00:21:33,080 --> 00:21:34,760
I I used to do everything like in

531
00:21:34,760 --> 00:21:36,919
perfect Symmetry and perfect shape

532
00:21:36,919 --> 00:21:38,080
symmetry is still good though we're not

533
00:21:38,080 --> 00:21:40,080
going to be bashing on symmetry so

534
00:21:40,080 --> 00:21:41,559
regret that I regret that I said that

535
00:21:41,559 --> 00:21:43,320
already no one beats no one messes

536
00:21:43,320 --> 00:21:45,600
around with with the Symmetry is the

537
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:48,440
best thing ever but let's uh not go for

538
00:21:48,440 --> 00:21:51,480
symmetry this time scale it down G to

539
00:21:51,480 --> 00:21:54,120
move it and control R I just want it to

540
00:21:54,120 --> 00:21:56,880
look a little bit like more natural

541
00:21:56,880 --> 00:21:58,799
control r

542
00:21:58,799 --> 00:22:02,919
uh G uh control r g there we go so

543
00:22:02,919 --> 00:22:04,640
here's our little foundation and now I'm

544
00:22:04,640 --> 00:22:06,720
going to do I have to do L to select the

545
00:22:06,720 --> 00:22:14,559
link l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l l

546
00:22:14,559 --> 00:22:16,120
i was actually proud I hit all of those

547
00:22:16,120 --> 00:22:17,919
in nice succession so I'm going to do

548
00:22:17,919 --> 00:22:21,720
shift d to duplicate this scale x minus

549
00:22:21,720 --> 00:22:24,039
one and then alt n because I need to

550
00:22:24,039 --> 00:22:25,919
recalculate outside you don't see that

551
00:22:25,919 --> 00:22:27,640
but the normals were all inverted after

552
00:22:27,640 --> 00:22:29,320
that little Flex move there there and

553
00:22:29,320 --> 00:22:31,000
I'm going to just move into that there

554
00:22:31,000 --> 00:22:32,120
and that's because the bridge is going

555
00:22:32,120 --> 00:22:33,600
to be moved from here so I do need to

556
00:22:33,600 --> 00:22:35,760
see like those parts there I'm also

557
00:22:35,760 --> 00:22:37,279
going to darken this part of the bridge

558
00:22:37,279 --> 00:22:38,760
I think a little bit compared to the

559
00:22:38,760 --> 00:22:41,120
stones that I've extruded so that was

560
00:22:41,120 --> 00:22:42,679
just like a little subtle down and I

561
00:22:42,679 --> 00:22:44,000
think I'm going to do the same for these

562
00:22:44,000 --> 00:22:46,559
two Foundation things move it maybe a

563
00:22:46,559 --> 00:22:48,039
little bit even darker on those

564
00:22:48,039 --> 00:22:50,600
something like that and also I should do

565
00:22:50,600 --> 00:22:52,840
on all of these I'm going to do shift G

566
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,360
when I've selected one of these triangle

567
00:22:54,360 --> 00:22:56,320
faces and I'm going to do select

568
00:22:56,320 --> 00:22:58,000
everything that has the same number of

569
00:22:58,000 --> 00:23:00,279
polygons sides so that selects all my

570
00:23:00,279 --> 00:23:01,919
little Edge wear ones and I'm going

571
00:23:01,919 --> 00:23:03,720
going to go a little bit brighter on

572
00:23:03,720 --> 00:23:06,520
those not much just a little Tad you

573
00:23:06,520 --> 00:23:07,720
don't really see it much here but I

574
00:23:07,720 --> 00:23:09,360
think in the game uh if I remember

575
00:23:09,360 --> 00:23:10,480
correctly it'll be a little bit more

576
00:23:10,480 --> 00:23:12,600
noticeable I also think I want to make

577
00:23:12,600 --> 00:23:16,039
it less regular here so contrl R going

578
00:23:16,039 --> 00:23:17,559
to Loop cut this I don't care too much

579
00:23:17,559 --> 00:23:20,080
that it's a lot of uh vers here cuz you

580
00:23:20,080 --> 00:23:22,200
don't you only see one bridge at a time

581
00:23:22,200 --> 00:23:23,799
and it's going to be cold uh as soon as

582
00:23:23,799 --> 00:23:25,279
you go out it's not going to be cold

583
00:23:25,279 --> 00:23:26,919
when you go out it's going to be cold

584
00:23:26,919 --> 00:23:30,240
when you go out cu l l something Ed or

585
00:23:30,240 --> 00:23:32,480
whatever my spelling is terrible I think

586
00:23:32,480 --> 00:23:34,080
I'm half dyslectic to be honest because

587
00:23:34,080 --> 00:23:36,360
I I really struggle to even spell my

588
00:23:36,360 --> 00:23:39,200
name sometimes so I don't do it too

589
00:23:39,200 --> 00:23:42,640
often yeah so g

590
00:23:42,640 --> 00:23:46,360
y GX oh okay I need to do o for

591
00:23:46,360 --> 00:23:47,600
proportional

592
00:23:47,600 --> 00:23:50,840
GX and then we'll just we're on like

593
00:23:50,840 --> 00:23:53,000
this jumbled thing so I'm just going to

594
00:23:53,000 --> 00:23:56,240
move it into there I think that's fine

595
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:58,440
yeah that's good and here I think I'm

596
00:23:58,440 --> 00:23:59,880
I'm also going to do like I'll shift

597
00:23:59,880 --> 00:24:02,960
select a few of these just want it more

598
00:24:02,960 --> 00:24:04,080
less

599
00:24:04,080 --> 00:24:07,520
perfect G to move that something like

600
00:24:07,520 --> 00:24:09,159
that we'll do maybe I'll do a few

601
00:24:09,159 --> 00:24:12,760
extrusions here as well so or I'm not

602
00:24:12,760 --> 00:24:13,880
going to extrude these I'm going to do

603
00:24:13,880 --> 00:24:16,640
shift the to duplicate them move them up

604
00:24:16,640 --> 00:24:18,039
scale them down slightly so they

605
00:24:18,039 --> 00:24:20,400
disappear G and then Al the extra long

606
00:24:20,400 --> 00:24:23,120
face normals in case I changed my mind

607
00:24:23,120 --> 00:24:26,640
so and I'll do Control Plus move them in

608
00:24:26,640 --> 00:24:28,000
and I don't care that there is some

609
00:24:28,000 --> 00:24:30,320
geomet tree that's hidden inside now cuz

610
00:24:30,320 --> 00:24:31,919
the overdraw on these the trees are a

611
00:24:31,919 --> 00:24:33,600
lot worse I should be addressing those

612
00:24:33,600 --> 00:24:35,960
if anything so I think something like

613
00:24:35,960 --> 00:24:37,960
that it looks hideous actually to be

614
00:24:37,960 --> 00:24:41,799
honest so credits to me for making stuff

615
00:24:41,799 --> 00:24:44,039
look horrible rotate maybe if I put a

616
00:24:44,039 --> 00:24:45,919
few more and stick them out a little bit

617
00:24:45,919 --> 00:24:49,720
less or something I don't know Shifty to

618
00:24:49,720 --> 00:24:54,600
duplicate G rotate

619
00:24:54,880 --> 00:24:57,320
maybe I don't know I don't know this

620
00:24:57,320 --> 00:24:59,120
reminds me of the dungeon we did like

621
00:24:59,120 --> 00:25:00,720
maybe four episodes ago or something

622
00:25:00,720 --> 00:25:02,360
like that it's a bit similar the style

623
00:25:02,360 --> 00:25:05,200
there maybe I'll just move it a hide a

624
00:25:05,200 --> 00:25:07,080
little bit more into

625
00:25:07,080 --> 00:25:09,960
here G okay maybe something like that

626
00:25:09,960 --> 00:25:12,159
and these are bothering me quite a lot

627
00:25:12,159 --> 00:25:14,640
to be honest uh I think I need to do

628
00:25:14,640 --> 00:25:16,440
some beveling in here just in case you

629
00:25:16,440 --> 00:25:18,159
see these on the side as well so control

630
00:25:18,159 --> 00:25:22,080
shift B here and we'll do the same

631
00:25:22,080 --> 00:25:26,320
here and maybe like that control shift

632
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:29,440
b control shift B on that on oh too much

633
00:25:29,440 --> 00:25:33,240
control shift B and something like that

634
00:25:33,240 --> 00:25:35,559
and these are too perfect as well G to

635
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:39,440
move it g to move that g to move it up

636
00:25:39,440 --> 00:25:42,159
and world I think i' if there was a

637
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:44,840
contest in Worlds itches nose I've won

638
00:25:44,840 --> 00:25:46,880
it like every time I record I even had

639
00:25:46,880 --> 00:25:48,880
to go to Ai and Google how come I get an

640
00:25:48,880 --> 00:25:52,279
itchy nose and it said if you're nervous

641
00:25:52,279 --> 00:25:54,159
it could itch but I'm not nervous so

642
00:25:54,159 --> 00:25:56,720
what's going on what else could it be is

643
00:25:56,720 --> 00:25:59,720
it cuz I'm concentrated

644
00:25:59,720 --> 00:26:01,399
no maybe I am nervous without even

645
00:26:01,399 --> 00:26:03,679
knowing about it probably not though so

646
00:26:03,679 --> 00:26:05,880
El select the link I'm also going to

647
00:26:05,880 --> 00:26:09,080
bring these up and Shrink them down G to

648
00:26:09,080 --> 00:26:11,679
move it and we'll put a few more Stones

649
00:26:11,679 --> 00:26:14,480
here maybe I'll just rotate this one the

650
00:26:14,480 --> 00:26:17,399
one here the better or it's going to be

651
00:26:17,399 --> 00:26:19,159
fun to see this in the game cuz I don't

652
00:26:19,159 --> 00:26:20,159
really know what it's going to look like

653
00:26:20,159 --> 00:26:21,880
to be

654
00:26:21,880 --> 00:26:24,360
honest G and I don't know if that

655
00:26:24,360 --> 00:26:25,880
Foundation was such a good idea I'm

656
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:27,919
actually going to do control B to Oh No

657
00:26:27,919 --> 00:26:31,000
Control B to Bevel that on GG to slide

658
00:26:31,000 --> 00:26:33,320
it I just want it to be like have some

659
00:26:33,320 --> 00:26:36,360
nice weird angles for the for the low

660
00:26:36,360 --> 00:26:38,880
poly light to reflect off to be honest

661
00:26:38,880 --> 00:26:40,320
and these are going to be like there's

662
00:26:40,320 --> 00:26:41,760
going to be more of these blocks coming

663
00:26:41,760 --> 00:26:42,880
down here so you're not going to see

664
00:26:42,880 --> 00:26:44,799
this too much and I'll probably just

665
00:26:44,799 --> 00:26:48,440
slap a big old collider on it so it's uh

666
00:26:48,440 --> 00:26:49,960
not going to be

667
00:26:49,960 --> 00:26:51,960
so like you're not going to be able to

668
00:26:51,960 --> 00:26:53,360
destroy the bridge anyway it doesn't

669
00:26:53,360 --> 00:26:56,480
need to be destructible so scale it down

670
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,120
G and we'll grab this this one too L

671
00:26:59,120 --> 00:27:00,919
select the link Shifty duplicate that

672
00:27:00,919 --> 00:27:04,159
one scale it down move it in something

673
00:27:04,159 --> 00:27:06,320
like this and then maybe this Edge

674
00:27:06,320 --> 00:27:09,480
contrl B bubble on I I keep doing

675
00:27:09,480 --> 00:27:11,200
control shift B because of the ver mode

676
00:27:11,200 --> 00:27:12,880
control B

677
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,039
GG move this in we're still on

678
00:27:16,039 --> 00:27:18,320
proportional so with the random that's

679
00:27:18,320 --> 00:27:20,640
absolutely fine cuz I like it to like

680
00:27:20,640 --> 00:27:21,919
still offset everything like that a

681
00:27:21,919 --> 00:27:23,480
little bit control maybe I'll do contrl

682
00:27:23,480 --> 00:27:28,279
B down here and GG to slide that on GG

683
00:27:28,279 --> 00:27:30,360
and that's good I don't care about end

684
00:27:30,360 --> 00:27:32,360
gon here either it's perfectly fine I'd

685
00:27:32,360 --> 00:27:35,360
say so control shift B that one I want

686
00:27:35,360 --> 00:27:37,600
to slice for some reason all right so

687
00:27:37,600 --> 00:27:40,080
maybe something like that we can try

688
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:41,200
this in the game now and see what it

689
00:27:41,200 --> 00:27:43,919
looks like maybe H I'm not so happy with

690
00:27:43,919 --> 00:27:46,880
the fact that these are like this so

691
00:27:46,880 --> 00:27:50,919
I'll move that on maybe I'll do G to

692
00:27:50,919 --> 00:27:54,600
move it out to here

693
00:27:54,600 --> 00:27:56,919
G okay maybe we'll just see what it

694
00:27:56,919 --> 00:27:58,919
looks like first and I also think I'm

695
00:27:58,919 --> 00:28:00,240
going to do like a fake ambient

696
00:28:00,240 --> 00:28:02,720
occlusion here so I'm going to let's see

697
00:28:02,720 --> 00:28:04,519
I'm going to select

698
00:28:04,519 --> 00:28:07,640
these shift select them and then just go

699
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:09,600
darker on those as well that are

700
00:28:09,600 --> 00:28:11,120
underneath there and the same thing I'm

701
00:28:11,120 --> 00:28:15,440
going to do here I'm going to do here

702
00:28:15,440 --> 00:28:17,039
and control selector here and then

703
00:28:17,039 --> 00:28:20,360
control plus a few times

704
00:28:20,360 --> 00:28:23,000
there and then here I'm also going to do

705
00:28:23,000 --> 00:28:25,600
a like darker like that so it looks like

706
00:28:25,600 --> 00:28:28,279
a bit of a shadow thing not not happy at

707
00:28:28,279 --> 00:28:29,880
all about these blocks to be honest so

708
00:28:29,880 --> 00:28:31,440
let's see if I even keep

709
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,080
those and then maybe I'll do a darker

710
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:36,200
one there does that make sense just for

711
00:28:36,200 --> 00:28:39,440
some feature I think so don't know why

712
00:28:39,440 --> 00:28:42,840
but and maybe I'll do e to extrude

713
00:28:42,840 --> 00:28:46,519
that okay without that

714
00:28:46,519 --> 00:28:49,880
one so we'll do tabing TI mode

715
00:28:49,880 --> 00:28:53,080
proportional off and then I'll

716
00:28:53,080 --> 00:28:55,960
do uh e to extrude in a little bit why

717
00:28:55,960 --> 00:28:58,880
am I doing that Global Med point is

718
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:03,279
everything inverted alt n recalculate

719
00:29:03,279 --> 00:29:05,440
outside and then I'll do oh it's because

720
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,120
I did the I probably select it all the

721
00:29:07,120 --> 00:29:10,360
way around so e to e to extrude it in

722
00:29:10,360 --> 00:29:11,960
there we go maybe I'll do something like

723
00:29:11,960 --> 00:29:14,679
that don't know why but I have a feeling

724
00:29:14,679 --> 00:29:17,080
I have a good feeling about it g to move

725
00:29:17,080 --> 00:29:19,320
it down that's good that makes some sort

726
00:29:19,320 --> 00:29:21,720
of a feature there as

727
00:29:21,720 --> 00:29:25,399
well and contrl B on this one bevel

728
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:28,960
contrl B GG I have no idea how much

729
00:29:28,960 --> 00:29:32,080
extra time I spent here now but please

730
00:29:32,080 --> 00:29:34,240
forgive me control

731
00:29:34,240 --> 00:29:36,960
B little Edge we there no that looks out

732
00:29:36,960 --> 00:29:38,440
of place all right so now we're going to

733
00:29:38,440 --> 00:29:40,120
bring this uh into the game and see what

734
00:29:40,120 --> 00:29:42,320
it looks like and see what I need to fix

735
00:29:42,320 --> 00:29:44,840
so it's called Stone Bridge that's fine

736
00:29:44,840 --> 00:29:47,960
so contrl s mark it everything's one

737
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,480
object that's perfectly fine file export

738
00:29:51,480 --> 00:29:54,000
fpx I'm going to do selected objects I'm

739
00:29:54,000 --> 00:29:58,080
going to go fpx units scale and then

740
00:29:58,080 --> 00:30:00,120
apply transform cuz we don't have uh an

741
00:30:00,120 --> 00:30:01,440
Armature on this one don't need

742
00:30:01,440 --> 00:30:04,640
animation and stuff so that's it and my

743
00:30:04,640 --> 00:30:06,000
project name is still called Soul

744
00:30:06,000 --> 00:30:07,640
Harvest before I picked the name of

745
00:30:07,640 --> 00:30:10,360
unfair Rampage so we go into Unity Soul

746
00:30:10,360 --> 00:30:14,240
Harvest assets meshes and we're going to

747
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:19,720
call it Stone Bridge 01 for some reason

748
00:30:19,720 --> 00:30:23,440
fpx and Export and now let's go into the

749
00:30:23,440 --> 00:30:25,679
game and it should already be in here so

750
00:30:25,679 --> 00:30:29,360
if we do uh doooo let's see I'm going to

751
00:30:29,360 --> 00:30:31,919
go open this one

752
00:30:31,919 --> 00:30:34,480
up and go

753
00:30:34,480 --> 00:30:37,519
to meshes we have that one here and

754
00:30:37,519 --> 00:30:39,480
stone bridge this this going to be

755
00:30:39,480 --> 00:30:40,880
interesting this might look absolutely

756
00:30:40,880 --> 00:30:43,960
hideous I don't know Stone Bridge we

757
00:30:43,960 --> 00:30:45,279
don't need to bring the material in cuz

758
00:30:45,279 --> 00:30:46,519
we're using the same material for

759
00:30:46,519 --> 00:30:48,279
everything everything else fine don't

760
00:30:48,279 --> 00:30:50,559
have to do much about that so now let's

761
00:30:50,559 --> 00:30:54,720
go into my prefabs folder here and we'll

762
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:59,919
go into level segment bridge is that

763
00:31:00,200 --> 00:31:04,039
one level set

764
00:31:04,120 --> 00:31:06,639
segment first why don't have a bridge

765
00:31:06,639 --> 00:31:09,600
one here

766
00:31:09,600 --> 00:31:12,399
end is this one double

767
00:31:12,399 --> 00:31:14,600
click yeah this is the

768
00:31:14,600 --> 00:31:17,919
one this uh is one this is one of the

769
00:31:17,919 --> 00:31:19,440
segments that's what what they look like

770
00:31:19,440 --> 00:31:22,440
so I'm going to duplicate this

771
00:31:22,760 --> 00:31:25,480
one and then we'll call it P2 instead I

772
00:31:25,480 --> 00:31:29,480
guess and

773
00:31:29,559 --> 00:31:31,919
set in the world record again itchy

774
00:31:31,919 --> 00:31:33,880
knows sorry if I'm disgusting anyone

775
00:31:33,880 --> 00:31:36,960
tough luck Look Away children there we

776
00:31:36,960 --> 00:31:40,919
go bring it in we've got the bridge here

777
00:31:40,919 --> 00:31:44,559
somewhere so we got meshes Stone Bridge

778
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:47,679
I remember here we go drag it into like

779
00:31:47,679 --> 00:31:48,480
here

780
00:31:48,480 --> 00:31:52,760
somewhere and rotate it on the let's see

781
00:31:52,760 --> 00:31:55,399
rotate hot keys from Unity is not

782
00:31:55,399 --> 00:31:57,480
working here or from uh well from Unity

783
00:31:57,480 --> 00:32:00,600
they're working cuz this is Unity so how

784
00:32:00,600 --> 00:32:04,440
many degrees am I rotating this thing

785
00:32:04,559 --> 00:32:07,440
now all right

786
00:32:07,440 --> 00:32:12,159
so transform let's see need to go to 90°

787
00:32:12,159 --> 00:32:13,880
there we go and I need to slap the

788
00:32:13,880 --> 00:32:15,840
colors on here now so let's go for my

789
00:32:15,840 --> 00:32:18,639
infancia pix pile texture

790
00:32:18,639 --> 00:32:22,480
materials pix pile urp Stonebridge let's

791
00:32:22,480 --> 00:32:25,559
go mesh render lit let's replace replace

792
00:32:25,559 --> 00:32:28,760
you with the infancia pix pile texture

793
00:32:28,760 --> 00:32:30,440
and sorry Bridge you're going to go but

794
00:32:30,440 --> 00:32:32,679
I'm first also going to put a collider

795
00:32:32,679 --> 00:32:34,440
on you so I see what I've done here

796
00:32:34,440 --> 00:32:37,039
going to do mesh collider and it can be

797
00:32:37,039 --> 00:32:38,720
it doesn't have to be convex it can be

798
00:32:38,720 --> 00:32:40,880
concave but we also have let's see this

799
00:32:40,880 --> 00:32:44,639
is ground layer on this bridge

800
00:32:44,639 --> 00:32:47,880
right there we go ground yeah so I'm

801
00:32:47,880 --> 00:32:51,039
going to go on this one and select layer

802
00:32:51,039 --> 00:32:54,159
ground where are you these are my layers

803
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:58,120
in the game ground layer W to move here

804
00:32:58,120 --> 00:32:59,679
bit of a different key and we'll delete

805
00:32:59,679 --> 00:33:01,880
you it's been nice knowing your bridge

806
00:33:01,880 --> 00:33:05,080
and put you stone bridge in here as well

807
00:33:05,080 --> 00:33:07,120
and we'll snap you into place there so

808
00:33:07,120 --> 00:33:09,360
we' got a little bit of an issue because

809
00:33:09,360 --> 00:33:13,279
the water there is uh flowing like

810
00:33:13,279 --> 00:33:15,880
through the thing it's not

811
00:33:15,880 --> 00:33:18,000
optimal so we'll have to figure out how

812
00:33:18,000 --> 00:33:19,200
to solve

813
00:33:19,200 --> 00:33:22,320
this so maybe I can just do let's scale

814
00:33:22,320 --> 00:33:23,919
this thing and make it a little bit

815
00:33:23,919 --> 00:33:27,240
wider not that wider so let's go this

816
00:33:27,240 --> 00:33:28,799
one off

817
00:33:28,799 --> 00:33:31,559
I should probably try to fix this

818
00:33:31,559 --> 00:33:33,480
instead somehow but let's just put the

819
00:33:33,480 --> 00:33:37,360
bridge higher then shall we why not

820
00:33:37,360 --> 00:33:40,799
there and we can make a little staircase

821
00:33:40,799 --> 00:33:42,799
here so these blocks I can just uh go

822
00:33:42,799 --> 00:33:44,120
control D to

823
00:33:44,120 --> 00:33:46,240
duplicate and now we need snapping back

824
00:33:46,240 --> 00:33:47,720
on here so this is how I design my

825
00:33:47,720 --> 00:33:49,440
levels in this game very simple I don't

826
00:33:49,440 --> 00:33:51,320
use like a tile map editor or anything

827
00:33:51,320 --> 00:33:54,039
like that so I'm going to be doing like

828
00:33:54,039 --> 00:33:57,279
this instead and we'll do control D

829
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,519
duplicate that one to there contrl D to

830
00:34:00,519 --> 00:34:03,039
duplicate and crl

831
00:34:03,039 --> 00:34:06,279
d and there we go then we're going to go

832
00:34:06,279 --> 00:34:09,079
contrl D to duplicate this one bring it

833
00:34:09,079 --> 00:34:12,839
into there contrl d control D and contrl

834
00:34:12,839 --> 00:34:16,480
D A little staircase coming up to

835
00:34:16,480 --> 00:34:19,760
Here There we go so that looks a bit

836
00:34:19,760 --> 00:34:21,800
stupid cuz I've got this tree here so

837
00:34:21,800 --> 00:34:23,599
let's raise you

838
00:34:23,599 --> 00:34:26,000
up I like to keep the purple Treese

839
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,480
there because it's uh like

840
00:34:28,480 --> 00:34:30,520
it's uh reminds me that I've reached one

841
00:34:30,520 --> 00:34:32,679
of I I mean I've got the purple trees in

842
00:34:32,679 --> 00:34:34,240
other places as well we need to switch

843
00:34:34,240 --> 00:34:36,679
this one to Global and bring that My

844
00:34:36,679 --> 00:34:38,119
Little Foundation block up there

845
00:34:38,119 --> 00:34:40,440
decorative there we go and then maybe

846
00:34:40,440 --> 00:34:42,639
we'll also bring these decorations up as

847
00:34:42,639 --> 00:34:44,280
well so we can see the grass up here so

848
00:34:44,280 --> 00:34:46,760
we'll snap those up there a little bit

849
00:34:46,760 --> 00:34:48,919
difficult to

850
00:34:48,919 --> 00:34:51,839
see but I think we're all

851
00:34:51,839 --> 00:34:55,040
good there we go bring it down to there

852
00:34:55,040 --> 00:34:56,520
and I'm also going to create some more

853
00:34:56,520 --> 00:34:58,280
decorate decorations I only have this

854
00:34:58,280 --> 00:35:00,880
one grass prefab that I need to do and

855
00:35:00,880 --> 00:35:02,320
see that these are swaying as well this

856
00:35:02,320 --> 00:35:04,800
is a Shader that I made in Shader graph

857
00:35:04,800 --> 00:35:07,760
so it just over time it adds Some Noise

858
00:35:07,760 --> 00:35:09,520
uh I have it on the trees as well I

859
00:35:09,520 --> 00:35:11,200
think it works really good on these

860
00:35:11,200 --> 00:35:13,000
little I should cover that in a video

861
00:35:13,000 --> 00:35:16,000
too I guess so contrl D to duplicate

862
00:35:16,000 --> 00:35:18,079
that one into there and these are not

863
00:35:18,079 --> 00:35:20,160
really that perfectly aligned either but

864
00:35:20,160 --> 00:35:22,839
rotate maybe I'll do something like that

865
00:35:22,839 --> 00:35:24,079
that looks stupid that they're coming

866
00:35:24,079 --> 00:35:27,000
out this way I don't care I think it's

867
00:35:27,000 --> 00:35:29,240
fine control to duplicate that one and

868
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:31,680
there we go we got a little stairs

869
00:35:31,680 --> 00:35:33,119
coming up there I'll do the same on this

870
00:35:33,119 --> 00:35:35,000
side cuz there's no point hiding these

871
00:35:35,000 --> 00:35:37,680
little nice grass strands on the back

872
00:35:37,680 --> 00:35:40,880
here so I'm going to control Z move them

873
00:35:40,880 --> 00:35:43,280
up to here and what else did we have

874
00:35:43,280 --> 00:35:45,240
this difficult to see here actually I

875
00:35:45,240 --> 00:35:46,960
just realized again that you can do the

876
00:35:46,960 --> 00:35:49,280
same hot Keys as you can in

877
00:35:49,280 --> 00:35:52,319
uh uh Unreal Engine so if you right

878
00:35:52,319 --> 00:35:54,839
click and do W ASD you can actually

879
00:35:54,839 --> 00:35:57,680
navigate here so that's kind of cool

880
00:35:57,680 --> 00:35:59,200
control D to

881
00:35:59,200 --> 00:36:01,040
duplicate and these are not going to be

882
00:36:01,040 --> 00:36:04,599
seen much cuz it's non-destructible here

883
00:36:04,599 --> 00:36:08,000
but control D to duplicate that one and

884
00:36:08,000 --> 00:36:10,000
I I don't really see what I'm doing

885
00:36:10,000 --> 00:36:14,200
here to be honest but that's okay if you

886
00:36:14,200 --> 00:36:15,839
if I don't see it like looking from

887
00:36:15,839 --> 00:36:17,599
behind no one's going to see it from the

888
00:36:17,599 --> 00:36:20,960
front either so I think we're good

889
00:36:20,960 --> 00:36:23,760
something like that maybe

890
00:36:23,760 --> 00:36:26,400
and I think I might add a little bit

891
00:36:26,400 --> 00:36:29,760
more like detail to this um at some

892
00:36:29,760 --> 00:36:31,119
point but I think we're going to give

893
00:36:31,119 --> 00:36:32,880
this one a go now

894
00:36:32,880 --> 00:36:36,440
so maybe we'll do

895
00:36:36,440 --> 00:36:39,359
uh here now I need to just modify the

896
00:36:39,359 --> 00:36:41,400
game a little bit to see here in the

897
00:36:41,400 --> 00:36:43,800
level

898
00:36:44,560 --> 00:36:47,560
prefab so we're going to go

899
00:36:47,560 --> 00:36:49,640
to do you know what I can do actually I

900
00:36:49,640 --> 00:36:51,800
can try it straight away so instead of

901
00:36:51,800 --> 00:36:53,240
running all the way to a bridge now cuz

902
00:36:53,240 --> 00:36:55,400
that would take some time I can go into

903
00:36:55,400 --> 00:36:57,880
my prefab

904
00:36:57,880 --> 00:37:00,520
if I find it again

905
00:37:00,520 --> 00:37:05,480
so P comes uh before s true and we've

906
00:37:05,480 --> 00:37:07,599
got level here somewhere this is my

907
00:37:07,599 --> 00:37:10,119
giant like level thing this is the first

908
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:11,440
level and then it just spawns a whole

909
00:37:11,440 --> 00:37:12,640
bunch of things I've got a little

910
00:37:12,640 --> 00:37:14,440
setting in here where I can do test only

911
00:37:14,440 --> 00:37:16,760
this segment so this is a little thing

912
00:37:16,760 --> 00:37:18,760
that I did so it and I can search here

913
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:20,720
why don't I use that

914
00:37:20,720 --> 00:37:23,599
level okay and I need to go to assets

915
00:37:23,599 --> 00:37:25,160
here and then we'll

916
00:37:25,160 --> 00:37:29,079
see P2 end this is the one we created so

917
00:37:29,079 --> 00:37:30,800
now we'll only have this level segment

918
00:37:30,800 --> 00:37:33,200
in the game here so we'll see how that

919
00:37:33,200 --> 00:37:35,640
goes so it won't be any enemies now but

920
00:37:35,640 --> 00:37:37,440
that's

921
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:41,359
fine play and we're going to be off now

922
00:37:41,359 --> 00:37:44,760
wooo here we go oh jump

923
00:37:44,760 --> 00:37:49,160
shoot and okay why did it not put my oh

924
00:37:49,160 --> 00:37:51,280
I modified the wrong one

925
00:37:51,280 --> 00:37:54,720
now I modified the the other one all

926
00:37:54,720 --> 00:37:58,280
right never mind so I cop it and then I

927
00:37:58,280 --> 00:38:00,359
modified the original but that's okay

928
00:38:00,359 --> 00:38:02,800
that's not a problem I'll just fix

929
00:38:02,800 --> 00:38:05,680
it here we go that's good it gives me a

930
00:38:05,680 --> 00:38:07,280
chance to do the new spin kick on this

931
00:38:07,280 --> 00:38:09,680
uh character instead then check this

932
00:38:09,680 --> 00:38:14,119
out woo there we go oh there's our

933
00:38:14,119 --> 00:38:17,040
bridge and I can run across it the rails

934
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,839
are a little bit big I look like a

935
00:38:18,839 --> 00:38:21,140
little on there

936
00:38:21,140 --> 00:38:23,880
[Music]

937
00:38:23,880 --> 00:38:26,400
what and what happens if I shoot this

938
00:38:26,400 --> 00:38:28,599
yeah oh but it works I mean I just need

939
00:38:28,599 --> 00:38:31,440
to tidy it up a little

940
00:38:32,400 --> 00:38:35,119
bit Why didn't it

941
00:38:35,119 --> 00:38:38,079
um trigger it should have triggered like

942
00:38:38,079 --> 00:38:41,319
a Slowdown should it

943
00:38:45,359 --> 00:38:47,480
restart there we

944
00:38:47,480 --> 00:38:49,880
go okay I have to put a collider here

945
00:38:49,880 --> 00:38:51,240
somewhere or like a trigger thing

946
00:38:51,240 --> 00:38:53,000
because it's meant to trigger here you

947
00:38:53,000 --> 00:38:54,359
can also see that there is a bit of

948
00:38:54,359 --> 00:38:56,040
offsets between the different level

949
00:38:56,040 --> 00:38:58,040
segments this one's up here

950
00:38:58,040 --> 00:38:59,920
and this one is offset down a little bit

951
00:38:59,920 --> 00:39:01,720
so this is all the level segments that

952
00:39:01,720 --> 00:39:03,319
adds a little bit variation to the game

953
00:39:03,319 --> 00:39:07,119
as well that they're like that woo dash

954
00:39:07,119 --> 00:39:09,160
dash dash dash I'm I'm going to win I'm

955
00:39:09,160 --> 00:39:12,240
going to win check this out next thing

956
00:39:12,240 --> 00:39:13,800
I'm going to do is probably some more

957
00:39:13,800 --> 00:39:15,920
back backdrop stuff I need the castles

958
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,520
and stuff in the in the distant

959
00:39:17,520 --> 00:39:20,560
background there so like looking at this

960
00:39:20,560 --> 00:39:22,400
the few twink tweaks that I'll probably

961
00:39:22,400 --> 00:39:23,720
do before I put them in the game I need

962
00:39:23,720 --> 00:39:25,280
to do something so the railing isn't

963
00:39:25,280 --> 00:39:26,800
blocking my face I need to make that a

964
00:39:26,800 --> 00:39:29,119
little bit smaller probably and the

965
00:39:29,119 --> 00:39:31,040
blocks at the bottom here I'm not happy

966
00:39:31,040 --> 00:39:32,280
with that I need some more

967
00:39:32,280 --> 00:39:34,280
irregularities there so I'll probably

968
00:39:34,280 --> 00:39:37,079
tweak those blocks other than that I

969
00:39:37,079 --> 00:39:40,160
think um yeah so it probably needs maybe

970
00:39:40,160 --> 00:39:42,880
about uh 20 minutes more attention to it

971
00:39:42,880 --> 00:39:45,040
before uh these as well here in the

972
00:39:45,040 --> 00:39:46,800
center are a little bit too like square

973
00:39:46,800 --> 00:39:50,079
and stuff so I think there's room to

974
00:39:50,079 --> 00:39:51,599
improve the bridge a little bit more but

975
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:54,640
as a start thing for 10 minutes plus

976
00:39:54,640 --> 00:39:56,400
whatever Tinker Time we did I think it

977
00:39:56,400 --> 00:39:58,880
works pretty good all right thanks for

978
00:39:58,880 --> 00:40:02,560
