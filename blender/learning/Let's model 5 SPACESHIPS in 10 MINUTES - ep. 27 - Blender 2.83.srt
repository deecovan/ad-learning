1
00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:01,530
hope you've had a good week so far it's

2
00:00:01,530 --> 00:00:04,490
gonna be episode 27 of the lope oh no

3
00:00:04,490 --> 00:00:06,779
I'm in Sweden where it's usually quite

4
00:00:06,779 --> 00:00:09,150
cold and right now it's too warm for me

5
00:00:09,150 --> 00:00:10,920
it's 28 degrees Celsius and that's like

6
00:00:10,920 --> 00:00:11,820
a sauna for me

7
00:00:11,820 --> 00:00:13,500
so struggling here a little bit but I'm

8
00:00:13,500 --> 00:00:14,759
in the basement at least that's the

9
00:00:14,759 --> 00:00:16,740
coolest place in the house literally

10
00:00:16,740 --> 00:00:18,600
because there's my computer room as well

11
00:00:18,600 --> 00:00:19,800
like I said I hope you've had a good

12
00:00:19,800 --> 00:00:22,500
week so far and it's time for episode 27

13
00:00:22,500 --> 00:00:24,210
of the ten minute modelling challenge so

14
00:00:24,210 --> 00:00:26,250
welcome to that one I'm excited this

15
00:00:26,250 --> 00:00:28,019
past week I've worked on the game the

16
00:00:28,019 --> 00:00:29,699
RTS game quite a bit I've there played a

17
00:00:29,699 --> 00:00:32,040
little bit EVE Online with my son I used

18
00:00:32,040 --> 00:00:35,579
to play that game 2004 to 2006 so that's

19
00:00:35,579 --> 00:00:37,890
a long time ago and I'm a space fan

20
00:00:37,890 --> 00:00:39,960
really loved that game but it just takes

21
00:00:39,960 --> 00:00:41,579
up too much time but now dropped in a

22
00:00:41,579 --> 00:00:42,870
little bit during the last week because

23
00:00:42,870 --> 00:00:45,120
my son plays it and he wants to get into

24
00:00:45,120 --> 00:00:46,950
it so I thought I'll spare some time I'm

25
00:00:46,950 --> 00:00:48,690
a complete noob so I'm not getting

26
00:00:48,690 --> 00:00:50,190
anything done I'm doing a few random

27
00:00:50,190 --> 00:00:52,230
missions and just there skilling up a

28
00:00:52,230 --> 00:00:53,430
little bit again so if you haven't

29
00:00:53,430 --> 00:00:54,480
played EVE Online you should try it

30
00:00:54,480 --> 00:00:55,770
maybe one day if you want to have no

31
00:00:55,770 --> 00:00:57,930
time left in your life I don't want if

32
00:00:57,930 --> 00:00:59,699
you've already got no time and then you

33
00:00:59,699 --> 00:01:01,050
tried Eve that's the real challenge

34
00:01:01,050 --> 00:01:03,149
another thing I did last week was I

35
00:01:03,149 --> 00:01:05,430
edited a video I've created a low poly

36
00:01:05,430 --> 00:01:07,619
tutorial so it's about an hour and a

37
00:01:07,619 --> 00:01:09,570
half long so like a full feature film

38
00:01:09,570 --> 00:01:11,970
really too long probably but I wanted to

39
00:01:11,970 --> 00:01:13,500
make a video I've had a lot of requests

40
00:01:13,500 --> 00:01:15,960
to do a slow video where I'd go through

41
00:01:15,960 --> 00:01:18,299
everything in detail so in contrast to

42
00:01:18,299 --> 00:01:20,250
these 10 min builds I've made that video

43
00:01:20,250 --> 00:01:21,720
now so I'm gonna publish it and it's

44
00:01:21,720 --> 00:01:23,040
basically everything I've learned about

45
00:01:23,040 --> 00:01:24,960
low poly modeling in one long video

46
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:27,299
where I talk a lot I haven't even put

47
00:01:27,299 --> 00:01:29,369
any music in that video being one and a

48
00:01:29,369 --> 00:01:30,930
half hours I thought people can choose

49
00:01:30,930 --> 00:01:32,820
their own music and won't have that and

50
00:01:32,820 --> 00:01:34,950
then they can skip forward back and hear

51
00:01:34,950 --> 00:01:36,619
what I say hopefully to celebrate

52
00:01:36,619 --> 00:01:38,640
space-themed I haven't done space in a

53
00:01:38,640 --> 00:01:40,140
long time and I'm gonna try to make

54
00:01:40,140 --> 00:01:42,750
spaceships as many as I can in ten

55
00:01:42,750 --> 00:01:44,399
minutes and I'm gonna make the modular

56
00:01:44,399 --> 00:01:45,659
if you've seen any of my past videos

57
00:01:45,659 --> 00:01:47,820
I've done some modular spaceships so I'm

58
00:01:47,820 --> 00:01:49,320
gonna try that now I'm gonna try to do

59
00:01:49,320 --> 00:01:50,700
that in ten minutes it's a bit of a time

60
00:01:50,700 --> 00:01:52,799
thief I think you know considering I

61
00:01:52,799 --> 00:01:54,329
made ten cars you might be easy to think

62
00:01:54,329 --> 00:01:56,520
I'll do at least 10 or more ships but

63
00:01:56,520 --> 00:01:58,200
don't think I'll even get that far so

64
00:01:58,200 --> 00:01:59,520
let's see how many we can do in 10

65
00:01:59,520 --> 00:02:02,189
minutes yes it's taken on a mirror top

66
00:02:02,189 --> 00:02:04,649
internet mode free a select everything

67
00:02:04,649 --> 00:02:07,560
scale it down scale on the y-axis and

68
00:02:07,560 --> 00:02:08,729
then we're gonna make some modules here

69
00:02:08,729 --> 00:02:11,550
shift d on the y-axis for

70
00:02:11,550 --> 00:02:13,980
shift are a few times let's make six

71
00:02:13,980 --> 00:02:16,470
modules first one here control are it's

72
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,970
going to be a cockpit so I'll just scale

73
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,640
on proportional off scale it up control

74
00:02:20,640 --> 00:02:24,750
our scale that one up and let's do here

75
00:02:24,750 --> 00:02:30,240
as well Luke I am B and alt s to scale

76
00:02:30,240 --> 00:02:32,430
up that's it that's our cockpit so let's

77
00:02:32,430 --> 00:02:34,530
make it like here's another thing let's

78
00:02:34,530 --> 00:02:36,360
make just some random shape a bit

79
00:02:36,360 --> 00:02:37,310
similar to that one

80
00:02:37,310 --> 00:02:44,310
l scale it up and let's scale that and

81
00:02:44,310 --> 00:02:46,560
let's scale this I'll just do some

82
00:02:46,560 --> 00:02:47,430
random edits here

83
00:02:47,430 --> 00:02:50,810
oh god no clear what I'm doing all the

84
00:02:50,810 --> 00:02:54,750
scale let's do all select that one I to

85
00:02:54,750 --> 00:02:58,140
inset all T face normals and let's do

86
00:02:58,140 --> 00:02:59,400
something as well just to make a little

87
00:02:59,400 --> 00:03:02,100
bit more interesting I to inset that all

88
00:03:02,100 --> 00:03:06,630
t to extrude scale have to fix this it's

89
00:03:06,630 --> 00:03:10,860
a bit broken so that's a some well

90
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:12,570
flatten it a bit looks a bit too chubby

91
00:03:12,570 --> 00:03:15,570
to to round L scales okay that's gonna

92
00:03:15,570 --> 00:03:17,700
have to be it let's do some weird module

93
00:03:17,700 --> 00:03:21,360
here and maybe six cups all select these

94
00:03:21,360 --> 00:03:25,680
it--in set and period and go to

95
00:03:25,680 --> 00:03:27,330
individual origins scale those down

96
00:03:27,330 --> 00:03:29,430
let's make that orange have it glow a

97
00:03:29,430 --> 00:03:31,650
little bit here another module let's

98
00:03:31,650 --> 00:03:32,880
just make something a little bit longer

99
00:03:32,880 --> 00:03:36,480
maybe control or again move that back

100
00:03:36,480 --> 00:03:40,800
move it out control our it sounds like

101
00:03:40,800 --> 00:03:42,530
the Pirates control

102
00:03:42,530 --> 00:03:44,760
but then a missile like a pirate anyway

103
00:03:44,760 --> 00:03:48,450
that's okay Alti make some other module

104
00:03:48,450 --> 00:03:51,110
here maybe

105
00:03:51,200 --> 00:03:54,120
right insert that each extrude best

106
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,120
scale and let's bring the salute extra

107
00:03:57,120 --> 00:03:58,980
Buster scale how am i doing 802 okay

108
00:03:58,980 --> 00:04:01,560
let's make an engine here I need some

109
00:04:01,560 --> 00:04:06,420
more space for that so I'm going to

110
00:04:06,420 --> 00:04:09,150
disable clipping on that on and move it

111
00:04:09,150 --> 00:04:13,230
out and press F to cap it ctrl R let's

112
00:04:13,230 --> 00:04:15,810
loop cut it not that we control or

113
00:04:15,810 --> 00:04:20,608
control the part I'll scale why control

114
00:04:20,608 --> 00:04:25,890
R let's loop cut here scale that down

115
00:04:25,890 --> 00:04:29,040
oh I have to go to edge select a scale

116
00:04:29,040 --> 00:04:33,960
on the Z scale on X okay and here let's

117
00:04:33,960 --> 00:04:36,810
make the engine eat extrude oh I forgot

118
00:04:36,810 --> 00:04:39,390
I'm not in the mirror section here e to

119
00:04:39,390 --> 00:04:42,870
extrude s to scale I to inset e to

120
00:04:42,870 --> 00:04:44,640
extrude n control force a few times

121
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:47,300
making block in the back us in a bit

122
00:04:47,300 --> 00:04:51,930
dark here we need to also do ITIN set e

123
00:04:51,930 --> 00:04:55,650
to extrude control also me to there make

124
00:04:55,650 --> 00:04:58,560
that dark control our six loop cuts here

125
00:04:58,560 --> 00:04:59,010
as well

126
00:04:59,010 --> 00:05:02,160
scale on the y-axis okay we need medium

127
00:05:02,160 --> 00:05:06,479
scale Y and let's do some loop

128
00:05:06,479 --> 00:05:10,260
selections here I 10 set and alt s to

129
00:05:10,260 --> 00:05:13,680
scale them down and make them and we

130
00:05:13,680 --> 00:05:15,930
need a wing as well so L clipping is off

131
00:05:15,930 --> 00:05:20,010
what's the F to cap it clipping on scale

132
00:05:20,010 --> 00:05:22,620
that let's make it flat e to extrude s

133
00:05:22,620 --> 00:05:25,560
to scale e to extrude s to scale here we

134
00:05:25,560 --> 00:05:27,510
go e to extrude as the scale I'm going

135
00:05:27,510 --> 00:05:29,340
to bring this up a little bit and then

136
00:05:29,340 --> 00:05:31,890
ctrl + rotate on the y axis and get some

137
00:05:31,890 --> 00:05:34,950
bender to this one move it in control

138
00:05:34,950 --> 00:05:38,010
art let's make a loop cut here as well

139
00:05:38,010 --> 00:05:43,080
scale it I didn't set that on scale that

140
00:05:43,080 --> 00:05:46,200
and make it orange to draw okay 6:15

141
00:05:46,200 --> 00:05:47,520
arms have to start making some

142
00:05:47,520 --> 00:05:49,650
spaceships now so let's select this

143
00:05:49,650 --> 00:05:51,710
whole object shift D to duplicate at X

144
00:05:51,710 --> 00:05:54,120
minus 8 and shift

145
00:05:54,120 --> 00:05:58,020
maybe I'll just to 5 that's probably all

146
00:05:58,020 --> 00:06:00,700
so let's start assembling here this one

147
00:06:00,700 --> 00:06:04,270
will just make scale on the y-axis bring

148
00:06:04,270 --> 00:06:07,300
that on in able to select the linked put

149
00:06:07,300 --> 00:06:08,680
it there I'll just have to do something

150
00:06:08,680 --> 00:06:12,630
wrong to me rotates on the x-axis and

151
00:06:12,630 --> 00:06:16,780
here get grab an engine not on there

152
00:06:16,780 --> 00:06:19,120
that's gonna have to do first one I

153
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,400
don't have to change so much so that's

154
00:06:21,400 --> 00:06:24,370
our first spaceship here another

155
00:06:24,370 --> 00:06:27,790
cockpits tab into that one and let's

156
00:06:27,790 --> 00:06:32,190
move that today I have to move control

157
00:06:32,190 --> 00:06:35,170
okay I don't know why that's happened

158
00:06:35,170 --> 00:06:38,380
well I've changed the center point here

159
00:06:38,380 --> 00:06:40,710
which is really frustrating there we go

160
00:06:40,710 --> 00:06:44,950
okay and scale X okay how should I do

161
00:06:44,950 --> 00:06:47,560
this one rotate on the z axis maybe move

162
00:06:47,560 --> 00:06:51,580
it out there let's rotate on the X let's

163
00:06:51,580 --> 00:06:56,790
make some weird rotate X shifty rotate X

164
00:06:56,790 --> 00:07:01,240
grab some engines maybe I'll put one

165
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,290
here and grab some wings here what's

166
00:07:05,290 --> 00:07:08,040
happen here to these

167
00:07:09,999 --> 00:07:12,699
okay I've done something here so this

168
00:07:12,699 --> 00:07:17,619
one's gonna have no wings apparently we

169
00:07:17,619 --> 00:07:18,639
can just make something else then

170
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:23,559
instead eat extrude that's the scale

171
00:07:23,559 --> 00:07:26,319
that's gonna be at 435 I don't know what

172
00:07:26,319 --> 00:07:27,219
happened to that wing I probably

173
00:07:27,219 --> 00:07:31,779
destroyed it someone here L white Zeus

174
00:07:31,779 --> 00:07:33,759
get on why here let's make something on

175
00:07:33,759 --> 00:07:36,729
the scale a lot and maybe rotate on the

176
00:07:36,729 --> 00:07:42,029
y-axis as well get that one said there

177
00:07:42,029 --> 00:07:49,619
let's grab it today L on this one scale

178
00:07:49,619 --> 00:07:53,919
okay what should we do this on rotate X

179
00:07:53,919 --> 00:07:57,519
again scale it up a little bit down to

180
00:07:57,519 --> 00:08:00,519
here maybe shifty duplicate that one as

181
00:08:00,519 --> 00:08:03,519
well so 358 let's put some engines here

182
00:08:03,519 --> 00:08:06,789
I'll scale those and you're not a little

183
00:08:06,789 --> 00:08:09,339
bit should we do four engines on this

184
00:08:09,339 --> 00:08:13,809
beast thanks oh yeah some wings they

185
00:08:13,809 --> 00:08:16,469
were tiny about to scale these up to

186
00:08:16,469 --> 00:08:22,119
scale Oh rotate why we're running out of

187
00:08:22,119 --> 00:08:23,589
space between the ships here let's make

188
00:08:23,589 --> 00:08:24,759
something that looks a bit like an

189
00:08:24,759 --> 00:08:27,009
x-wing thing shifty I guess I have to

190
00:08:27,009 --> 00:08:28,149
separate these little bit later on

191
00:08:28,149 --> 00:08:29,979
doesn't matter if they're overlapping a

192
00:08:29,979 --> 00:08:32,019
little bit now I can fix that scale

193
00:08:32,019 --> 00:08:34,439
those down

194
00:08:35,669 --> 00:08:39,799
okay 3:23 let's make another ship here I

195
00:08:39,799 --> 00:08:41,909
have to move these south to give them

196
00:08:41,909 --> 00:08:44,850
some spaceship space G omit this one

197
00:08:44,850 --> 00:08:46,830
okay let's make some something else here

198
00:08:46,830 --> 00:08:50,610
L to select link but wider let's bring

199
00:08:50,610 --> 00:08:52,110
this out a little bit

200
00:08:52,110 --> 00:09:01,320
scale L rotate is that let's bring that

201
00:09:01,320 --> 00:09:07,340
back to there maybe rotate that L just

202
00:09:07,340 --> 00:09:11,160
make something chunky here as well shift

203
00:09:11,160 --> 00:09:14,070
D to duplicate that one move it out

204
00:09:14,070 --> 00:09:19,170
rotate X yeah select these linked I'm

205
00:09:19,170 --> 00:09:26,220
doing 240 shift D okay more engines so

206
00:09:26,220 --> 00:09:33,540
let's bring these so let's put scale to

207
00:09:33,540 --> 00:09:35,280
there maybe and then here what should we

208
00:09:35,280 --> 00:09:36,660
do these just bring these down I guess

209
00:09:36,660 --> 00:09:39,540
let's scale these wings scale on the y

210
00:09:39,540 --> 00:09:40,800
axis make them a bit longer

211
00:09:40,800 --> 00:09:42,540
you can probably pull this out as well

212
00:09:42,540 --> 00:09:46,350
make that one longer maybe do something

213
00:09:46,350 --> 00:09:50,730
like scale or e to extrude these stop

214
00:09:50,730 --> 00:09:55,440
them back to scale those down and out at

215
00:09:55,440 --> 00:09:59,370
sea 240 no - OH - what am I going on

216
00:09:59,370 --> 00:10:05,160
loves the thumb there maybe rotate Y

217
00:10:05,160 --> 00:10:07,590
that's Y okay

218
00:10:07,590 --> 00:10:09,300
one more ship and then I'll tweak the

219
00:10:09,300 --> 00:10:12,990
little bit as well l scale okay you

220
00:10:12,990 --> 00:10:14,580
should do some different type of design

221
00:10:14,580 --> 00:10:17,790
here maybe so let's go forward with this

222
00:10:17,790 --> 00:10:20,580
stuff here and help

223
00:10:20,580 --> 00:10:27,780
let's do clipping off cap those clipping

224
00:10:27,780 --> 00:10:34,920
on put them their engines their wings

225
00:10:34,920 --> 00:10:41,040
125 okay let's see scale there are some

226
00:10:41,040 --> 00:10:47,120
small ship here rotates on the y axis

227
00:10:50,150 --> 00:10:53,970
that in scale that thumb okay so I'll

228
00:10:53,970 --> 00:10:55,650
just tweak some of their I've got one

229
00:10:55,650 --> 00:10:56,910
minute to do so let's just do some

230
00:10:56,910 --> 00:10:59,460
tweaking to decent this one maybe could

231
00:10:59,460 --> 00:11:03,210
do with some feature here so select a

232
00:11:03,210 --> 00:11:06,060
few these items that those eat extra

233
00:11:06,060 --> 00:11:09,740
down and then call it up a bit darker

234
00:11:09,740 --> 00:11:12,870
there maybe what should we do this shift

235
00:11:12,870 --> 00:11:14,430
as well maybe we'll give it some

236
00:11:14,430 --> 00:11:16,770
features on the wing here as well and

237
00:11:16,770 --> 00:11:24,240
eats extrude up scale its scale okay

238
00:11:24,240 --> 00:11:26,670
and for this ship here we've got thirty

239
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:28,770
four seconds just do some more tweaks

240
00:11:28,770 --> 00:11:32,190
here so topping to that on scale up on

241
00:11:32,190 --> 00:11:35,340
down a bit here maybe select those I

242
00:11:35,340 --> 00:11:39,450
think sets each extrude select a few

243
00:11:39,450 --> 00:11:42,530
these I two inserts it extrudes I

244
00:11:42,530 --> 00:11:43,650
Tennyson

245
00:11:43,650 --> 00:11:45,600
eat extrude down and just make them

246
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:49,320
large thirteen seconds to go so I'm here

247
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,650
as well I ten sets each extruded s to

248
00:11:52,650 --> 00:11:58,590
scale but eat to extrude s to scale one

249
00:11:58,590 --> 00:11:59,940
second to go that's it

250
00:11:59,940 --> 00:12:03,650
one two three four five

251
00:12:07,130 --> 00:12:09,480
hmm recorded this one actually myself

252
00:12:09,480 --> 00:12:12,930
it's alert sound this is a big foghorn

253
00:12:12,930 --> 00:12:14,490
up here on the mountain near where I

254
00:12:14,490 --> 00:12:16,500
live so that goes off once a month and I

255
00:12:16,500 --> 00:12:17,910
recorded that for me some effects might

256
00:12:17,910 --> 00:12:20,130
be so here we go let's just arrange

257
00:12:20,130 --> 00:12:21,480
these ships a little bit no I won't

258
00:12:21,480 --> 00:12:24,120
modify them at all so let's just put

259
00:12:24,120 --> 00:12:26,640
them into place here okay so we've got

260
00:12:26,640 --> 00:12:29,010
maybe these aren't the most detailed of

261
00:12:29,010 --> 00:12:31,529
ships but we've got sort of different

262
00:12:31,529 --> 00:12:32,610
looking ships let's move them in a

263
00:12:32,610 --> 00:12:35,790
little bit into it so they're a bit

264
00:12:35,790 --> 00:12:38,850
better line top view maybe let's try to

265
00:12:38,850 --> 00:12:40,470
get the center of gravity here for all

266
00:12:40,470 --> 00:12:46,950
of them maybe like that one this one and

267
00:12:46,950 --> 00:12:49,140
this one so they've all got quite

268
00:12:49,140 --> 00:12:50,399
similar features on them because we're

269
00:12:50,399 --> 00:12:52,830
using the same model but I guess if

270
00:12:52,830 --> 00:12:54,720
you're making something like a top-down

271
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:56,490
shooter game or shoot them up or

272
00:12:56,490 --> 00:12:58,140
something like that then spaceships of

273
00:12:58,140 --> 00:13:00,660
this size are pretty decent they'll like

274
00:13:00,660 --> 00:13:02,220
basically if you keep them at this size

275
00:13:02,220 --> 00:13:04,020
and render them they'll look alright I

276
00:13:04,020 --> 00:13:06,029
think when you get the 3d shading when

277
00:13:06,029 --> 00:13:08,580
you rotate them you have another good

278
00:13:08,580 --> 00:13:10,470
thing with them being modules is that

279
00:13:10,470 --> 00:13:11,640
you can actually assemble the ships just

280
00:13:11,640 --> 00:13:13,200
the way you want you can make hundreds

281
00:13:13,200 --> 00:13:16,470
thousands not millions loads of ships

282
00:13:16,470 --> 00:13:18,060
are out of these modules and they'll all

283
00:13:18,060 --> 00:13:20,250
have a similar style I usually go crazy

284
00:13:20,250 --> 00:13:22,230
I've been made a video a few years ago

285
00:13:22,230 --> 00:13:23,970
where you can actually make a custom

286
00:13:23,970 --> 00:13:25,709
it's like a custom editor where you can

287
00:13:25,709 --> 00:13:27,990
assemble your own ships so I made about

288
00:13:27,990 --> 00:13:30,300
maybe 20-30 modules and you could

289
00:13:30,300 --> 00:13:31,800
basically create any ship with that one

290
00:13:31,800 --> 00:13:33,240
I had a lot of fun with it and I should

291
00:13:33,240 --> 00:13:34,830
probably pick that up something oh yeah

292
00:13:34,830 --> 00:13:36,600
what I was gonna say as well not only

293
00:13:36,600 --> 00:13:37,890
can you make a lot of ships with these

294
00:13:37,890 --> 00:13:40,020
modules another really handy thing is

295
00:13:40,020 --> 00:13:41,730
that you can blow the ships up and like

296
00:13:41,730 --> 00:13:43,800
have separate hitboxes for all the

297
00:13:43,800 --> 00:13:45,690
components and you can even animate them

298
00:13:45,690 --> 00:13:47,130
so you could for example link them

299
00:13:47,130 --> 00:13:49,200
together so when you rotate a wing you

300
00:13:49,200 --> 00:13:50,670
can have engines following along and

301
00:13:50,670 --> 00:13:52,890
things like that really really useful to

302
00:13:52,890 --> 00:13:55,170
make the modular and I've had a few

303
00:13:55,170 --> 00:13:57,630
people say or what about when you have a

304
00:13:57,630 --> 00:13:59,790
geometry that's like linked into each

305
00:13:59,790 --> 00:14:01,440
other so it won't that be wasting

306
00:14:01,440 --> 00:14:03,420
performance of your graphics card but I

307
00:14:03,420 --> 00:14:05,910
mean there's so few polygons there's so

308
00:14:05,910 --> 00:14:07,770
few triangles and your computers and

309
00:14:07,770 --> 00:14:09,360
everything even mobile phones will be

310
00:14:09,360 --> 00:14:12,209
able to render these like a beast they

311
00:14:12,209 --> 00:14:13,920
won't hardly take any performance and

312
00:14:13,920 --> 00:14:15,990
whatsoever so I wouldn't worry about the

313
00:14:15,990 --> 00:14:17,940
fact that it's geometry inside there I

314
00:14:17,940 --> 00:14:18,880
wouldn't even worry about

315
00:14:18,880 --> 00:14:21,490
a bit so go ahead go crazy with it maybe

316
00:14:21,490 --> 00:14:23,350
and it'll be fun to make a little unity

317
00:14:23,350 --> 00:14:24,700
project of this I don't know if a lot of

318
00:14:24,700 --> 00:14:26,650
time for that but if I were to put them

319
00:14:26,650 --> 00:14:29,140
in unity it could be fun to see them fly

320
00:14:29,140 --> 00:14:30,670
about a little bit maybe shoot and

321
00:14:30,670 --> 00:14:33,010
explode maybe I'll do that would you

322
00:14:33,010 --> 00:14:34,540
like to see that in a video maybe give

323
00:14:34,540 --> 00:14:35,950
me a shout in the comments if you do I

324
00:14:35,950 --> 00:14:37,600
want to give a big shout out as well to

325
00:14:37,600 --> 00:14:38,830
my heroic here

326
00:14:38,830 --> 00:14:42,220
discord admins I've got c64 gamer that I

327
00:14:42,220 --> 00:14:44,740
took and Alex rack to that are doing an

328
00:14:44,740 --> 00:14:46,900
amazing job to keep the discord up and

329
00:14:46,900 --> 00:14:48,610
running and they're also introducing

330
00:14:48,610 --> 00:14:50,020
some BOTS now because we're starting to

331
00:14:50,020 --> 00:14:52,210
we've hit over a thousand people so

332
00:14:52,210 --> 00:14:53,560
we're starting to get some issues with

333
00:14:53,560 --> 00:14:55,240
spamming and I'm so noobish when it

334
00:14:55,240 --> 00:14:57,970
comes to this chord so these heroes help

335
00:14:57,970 --> 00:14:59,770
me out a lot so thanks a lot for that

336
00:14:59,770 --> 00:15:01,480
guys I really appreciate it that's gonna

337
00:15:01,480 --> 00:15:03,190
be for this week I've spent so much time

338
00:15:03,190 --> 00:15:05,230
editing that low-poly video so if you

339
00:15:05,230 --> 00:15:06,970
don't have a look check out in the

340
00:15:06,970 --> 00:15:08,770
description or in my channel history and

341
00:15:08,770 --> 00:15:10,240
you can watch that video if you want an

342
00:15:10,240 --> 00:15:12,520
hour and a half this week so this video

343
00:15:12,520 --> 00:15:13,930
is gonna be shorter than my normal ones

344
00:15:13,930 --> 00:15:15,460
but I hope you come back next week and

345
00:15:15,460 --> 00:15:18,610
we'll do a pisode 28 them so until then

346
00:15:18,610 --> 00:15:21,400
