00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,039
okay

[Music]

8
00:00:43,800 --> 00:00:48,310
it's got PI it from jumping from the

9
00:00:48,310 --> 00:00:50,290
camera to here not a good sign

10
00:00:50,290 --> 00:00:52,150
alright guys and welcome back to episode

11
00:00:52,150 --> 00:00:54,220
number two of making the low-poly racer

12
00:00:54,220 --> 00:00:56,200
I'm super excited that the other video

13
00:00:56,200 --> 00:00:58,180
did so well I was really surprised that

14
00:00:58,180 --> 00:01:00,280
it had had a lot of use a lot of

15
00:01:00,280 --> 00:01:02,530
visitors a lot of the new subscribers as

16
00:01:02,530 --> 00:01:04,809
well so welcome to you guys I'll still

17
00:01:04,809 --> 00:01:06,220
spend a little bit more time in blender

18
00:01:06,220 --> 00:01:08,050
in this episode I've got a model some of

19
00:01:08,050 --> 00:01:10,360
the rocks and trees and some fences and

20
00:01:10,360 --> 00:01:12,940
Road barricades like yes tire sucks and

21
00:01:12,940 --> 00:01:14,229
things like that I'll slow down a few

22
00:01:14,229 --> 00:01:16,360
parts because it contains a few maybe

23
00:01:16,360 --> 00:01:17,680
trick tips and tricks that I haven't

24
00:01:17,680 --> 00:01:19,479
mentioned before so I have a look at

25
00:01:19,479 --> 00:01:21,550
those but then we'll start exporting the

26
00:01:21,550 --> 00:01:23,560
objects and bring them into unity so I'm

27
00:01:23,560 --> 00:01:25,300
also really happy to hear that so many

28
00:01:25,300 --> 00:01:28,090
people enjoy looking forward to the

29
00:01:28,090 --> 00:01:30,130
unity stuff because that's where I feel

30
00:01:30,130 --> 00:01:32,320
most at home I do blender but also the

31
00:01:32,320 --> 00:01:34,720
unity and I'd love to show you guys how

32
00:01:34,720 --> 00:01:36,340
we put this game together so I've had a

33
00:01:36,340 --> 00:01:37,960
lot of requests will you show the wheel

34
00:01:37,960 --> 00:01:39,490
physics will you show how to do the

35
00:01:39,490 --> 00:01:42,100
powerslides and how to do the colliders

36
00:01:42,100 --> 00:01:44,229
and yeah you name it so I'm gonna try to

37
00:01:44,229 --> 00:01:46,390
cover as much as I can in this series

38
00:01:46,390 --> 00:01:48,010
I'll jump back into blender for a bit

39
00:01:48,010 --> 00:01:49,479
and then we'll move on to exporting

40
00:01:49,479 --> 00:01:51,070
these things and bring them into unity

41
00:01:51,070 --> 00:01:52,960
and episode 3 will be pretty much all

42
00:01:52,960 --> 00:01:55,150
unity so stay tuned subscribe if you

43
00:01:55,150 --> 00:01:57,010
haven't already hit a like if you'd

44
00:01:57,010 --> 00:01:59,020
liked it and let's let's get a move on

45
00:01:59,020 --> 00:02:02,909
let's make this racing game happen again

46
00:02:03,390 --> 00:02:08,610
[Music]

47
00:02:08,610 --> 00:02:10,539
first of all we're going to create some

48
00:02:10,539 --> 00:02:11,800
stones they're gonna be used as

49
00:02:11,800 --> 00:02:14,350
decorations and obstacles so you can see

50
00:02:14,350 --> 00:02:15,850
here the car hits them maybe they're a

51
00:02:15,850 --> 00:02:17,080
little bit too light but it's easy

52
00:02:17,080 --> 00:02:19,270
enough to increase the mass of the rigid

53
00:02:19,270 --> 00:02:24,820
body immunity in blender I you do shift

54
00:02:24,820 --> 00:02:27,070
a and I create a new mesh it's gonna be

55
00:02:27,070 --> 00:02:29,980
a cube this time and I use I create

56
00:02:29,980 --> 00:02:31,840
these models in the same scene as I did

57
00:02:31,840 --> 00:02:34,450
before and it's just find a little bit

58
00:02:34,450 --> 00:02:36,310
easier to get the scale correct and I've

59
00:02:36,310 --> 00:02:38,290
already got the material set and don't

60
00:02:38,290 --> 00:02:40,180
be afraid that there's a lot of objects

61
00:02:40,180 --> 00:02:43,290
in your scene just hide a lot of them I

62
00:02:43,290 --> 00:02:46,090
pressed ctrl to to subdivide the mesh

63
00:02:46,090 --> 00:02:48,780
into two levels to create this stone and

64
00:02:48,780 --> 00:02:52,510
then I just select a few vertices and I

65
00:02:52,510 --> 00:02:55,209
switch into proportional editing you can

66
00:02:55,209 --> 00:02:58,180
hit o on your keyboard and that'll

67
00:02:58,180 --> 00:03:00,010
enable proportional editing so you can

68
00:03:00,010 --> 00:03:01,900
just start moving some objects use this

69
00:03:01,900 --> 00:03:04,630
mouse wheel to scroll it down and work

70
00:03:04,630 --> 00:03:07,150
up the regardless of what you need or

71
00:03:07,150 --> 00:03:08,890
depending on what you need and then you

72
00:03:08,890 --> 00:03:10,780
can just shape the stone a little bit to

73
00:03:10,780 --> 00:03:12,489
get a shape that you prefer

74
00:03:12,489 --> 00:03:14,080
it's not too picky about it I just

75
00:03:14,080 --> 00:03:15,520
played around with it a little bit to

76
00:03:15,520 --> 00:03:17,440
get some I like to have a flat bottom so

77
00:03:17,440 --> 00:03:19,570
they can rest nicely on the ground as

78
00:03:19,570 --> 00:03:21,310
well just there repeat this by moving

79
00:03:21,310 --> 00:03:24,010
some vertices around until you're happy

80
00:03:24,010 --> 00:03:26,410
with the stone shape then you can hit a

81
00:03:26,410 --> 00:03:28,630
to select all the vertices and then

82
00:03:28,630 --> 00:03:31,600
press shift D to duplicate the mesh and

83
00:03:31,600 --> 00:03:33,610
I'm still in the same object I've just

84
00:03:33,610 --> 00:03:36,430
the touch those or and attach them I've

85
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:38,620
duplicated those vertices and then I can

86
00:03:38,620 --> 00:03:40,180
create a new stone and just change the

87
00:03:40,180 --> 00:03:41,019
shape a little bit

88
00:03:41,019 --> 00:03:43,600
I often work inside the same object yeah

89
00:03:43,600 --> 00:03:45,459
I think it's easier to just duplicate

90
00:03:45,459 --> 00:03:47,890
the mesh inside of an object instead of

91
00:03:47,890 --> 00:03:49,959
necessarily duplicating the objects but

92
00:03:49,959 --> 00:03:52,300
it's up to whatever you prefer okay this

93
00:03:52,300 --> 00:03:54,070
is going to be a bit boring to watch so

94
00:03:54,070 --> 00:03:55,720
I'll fast forward this a little bit but

95
00:03:55,720 --> 00:03:58,300
I do a bunch of stones think five in

96
00:03:58,300 --> 00:03:59,980
total and just shape them a little

97
00:03:59,980 --> 00:04:01,780
different and have some different sizes

98
00:04:01,780 --> 00:04:03,370
you can always rescale them inside of

99
00:04:03,370 --> 00:04:06,400
unity later on as well but I made two to

100
00:04:06,400 --> 00:04:07,959
the last box I made a little bit larger

101
00:04:07,959 --> 00:04:09,370
and pointer you could use those as

102
00:04:09,370 --> 00:04:11,350
bigger obstacles if you want alright you

103
00:04:11,350 --> 00:04:14,049
can add a bevel modifier and that shapes

104
00:04:14,049 --> 00:04:15,519
the edges of the rocks a little bit as

105
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:16,630
you can see I

106
00:04:16,630 --> 00:04:18,820
like two maybe gives a little bit more

107
00:04:18,820 --> 00:04:20,589
of a cartoony look and you can play

108
00:04:20,589 --> 00:04:22,060
around a little bit with the angle

109
00:04:22,060 --> 00:04:24,250
settings to get the look and feel that

110
00:04:24,250 --> 00:04:25,990
you want again I think it breaks up the

111
00:04:25,990 --> 00:04:29,170
little plainness of the of the mesh so

112
00:04:29,170 --> 00:04:30,850
you can do it if you want and then you

113
00:04:30,850 --> 00:04:32,890
apply the modify and that will bake the

114
00:04:32,890 --> 00:04:35,320
changes into the mesh and then what I do

115
00:04:35,320 --> 00:04:37,600
is I add a subdivide modifier a

116
00:04:37,600 --> 00:04:39,820
subdivision modifier and that adds a lot

117
00:04:39,820 --> 00:04:41,500
more detail but I'm not gonna keep them

118
00:04:41,500 --> 00:04:43,570
like that so I add a decimate modifier

119
00:04:43,570 --> 00:04:45,670
which is a bit contract contradictive

120
00:04:45,670 --> 00:04:47,890
and then I slide it down and that's that

121
00:04:47,890 --> 00:04:51,250
actually reduces the the number of their

122
00:04:51,250 --> 00:04:52,960
faces again you wonder why I'm doing

123
00:04:52,960 --> 00:04:55,240
that but that's because I like to get

124
00:04:55,240 --> 00:04:58,210
them a bit irregular now we're gonna

125
00:04:58,210 --> 00:05:00,880
create some tires some type barriers

126
00:05:00,880 --> 00:05:02,620
they'll be used individually and in

127
00:05:02,620 --> 00:05:05,560
stacks of tires so again I'm in the same

128
00:05:05,560 --> 00:05:08,020
scene and I'm gonna use the car wheel so

129
00:05:08,020 --> 00:05:09,910
if you haven't seen when I model the

130
00:05:09,910 --> 00:05:11,800
cars check out that video but then I

131
00:05:11,800 --> 00:05:13,810
just hit L to select the linked part is

132
00:05:13,810 --> 00:05:15,820
this on the wheel itself and then I do

133
00:05:15,820 --> 00:05:17,920
shift D to duplicate the selection again

134
00:05:17,920 --> 00:05:19,870
into a separate mesh he could create

135
00:05:19,870 --> 00:05:21,820
this tire all the way from scratch again

136
00:05:21,820 --> 00:05:23,890
but since I had it I wanted to keep keep

137
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,200
the consistent look so I decided to

138
00:05:26,200 --> 00:05:29,890
duplicate it I applied the mirror

139
00:05:29,890 --> 00:05:32,710
modifier so I didn't have that messing

140
00:05:32,710 --> 00:05:34,030
around I could have probably just

141
00:05:34,030 --> 00:05:36,340
deleted a mirror modifier instead

142
00:05:36,340 --> 00:05:38,770
because I don't really need one wheel

143
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:42,340
but I decided the family to do that just

144
00:05:42,340 --> 00:05:45,250
remove the interior rimmed geometry and

145
00:05:45,250 --> 00:05:47,610
keep the tyre you select whichever

146
00:05:47,610 --> 00:05:49,540
vertices you want to delete and then you

147
00:05:49,540 --> 00:05:52,000
just delete them the faces in this case

148
00:05:52,000 --> 00:05:54,070
and then I ended up with a bit of a

149
00:05:54,070 --> 00:05:57,040
weird-looking tired so I had to shape it

150
00:05:57,040 --> 00:05:59,980
and fix it a little bit and I selected a

151
00:05:59,980 --> 00:06:01,720
face on the back that was solid I

152
00:06:01,720 --> 00:06:04,090
deleted that one clicked all left mouse

153
00:06:04,090 --> 00:06:06,550
to ring select the edge and then I slid

154
00:06:06,550 --> 00:06:09,360
it in and I hold the control key and do

155
00:06:09,360 --> 00:06:11,770
snapping so I get to the exact same

156
00:06:11,770 --> 00:06:14,770
location as the vertex or the inner rim

157
00:06:14,770 --> 00:06:18,280
I do f3 to bridge the edge loops and

158
00:06:18,280 --> 00:06:21,070
then that bridges the faces and now I've

159
00:06:21,070 --> 00:06:23,980
got a tire I applied the mirror modifier

160
00:06:23,980 --> 00:06:26,080
apparently I didn't do that one before

161
00:06:26,080 --> 00:06:28,510
and then I just delete I think here this

162
00:06:28,510 --> 00:06:29,940
one now my

163
00:06:29,940 --> 00:06:32,700
like a and I select the all the vertices

164
00:06:32,700 --> 00:06:35,010
and that is shift s a new cursor to

165
00:06:35,010 --> 00:06:38,550
selected the reason for this is I want

166
00:06:38,550 --> 00:06:40,290
to set the origin so press f3 and type

167
00:06:40,290 --> 00:06:43,050
set origin and then set it to the 3d

168
00:06:43,050 --> 00:06:47,730
cursor you have to do that in object

169
00:06:47,730 --> 00:06:49,500
mode so top out of edit mode and do that

170
00:06:49,500 --> 00:06:50,090
again

171
00:06:50,090 --> 00:06:53,580
so again f3 set origin and then I'd set

172
00:06:53,580 --> 00:06:55,560
it to the center of the mass for all the

173
00:06:55,560 --> 00:06:59,730
stones here as well origin to center of

174
00:06:59,730 --> 00:07:02,550
mass volume if you select that one

175
00:07:02,550 --> 00:07:04,980
it'll center the object volume on today

176
00:07:04,980 --> 00:07:11,910
I do this for all the stones we want to

177
00:07:11,910 --> 00:07:13,110
make sure that all the objects have a

178
00:07:13,110 --> 00:07:16,530
nice center position then for the wheel

179
00:07:16,530 --> 00:07:18,930
I rotate it so I hit R on the keyboard

180
00:07:18,930 --> 00:07:21,660
and I rotate it by typing Y 90 that will

181
00:07:21,660 --> 00:07:24,150
flip it nicely 90 degrees I move it down

182
00:07:24,150 --> 00:07:25,710
to the ground just so I can see what it

183
00:07:25,710 --> 00:07:28,380
looks like I'm gonna create this a stack

184
00:07:28,380 --> 00:07:29,730
of tires as well they're used as

185
00:07:29,730 --> 00:07:31,380
decorations and obstacles you can see

186
00:07:31,380 --> 00:07:32,940
the car hits them and they're a heavier

187
00:07:32,940 --> 00:07:35,490
in mass so they don't fly around as

188
00:07:35,490 --> 00:07:37,140
quickly as a tire and they'll save some

189
00:07:37,140 --> 00:07:38,730
performance as well by being a single

190
00:07:38,730 --> 00:07:41,370
big mesh press shift D in blender to

191
00:07:41,370 --> 00:07:43,140
duplicate the entire object that I did

192
00:07:43,140 --> 00:07:45,120
before and hit tab to go into edit mode

193
00:07:45,120 --> 00:07:47,790
and then I do shift D a bunch of time to

194
00:07:47,790 --> 00:07:50,820
duplicate the selected vertices I just

195
00:07:50,820 --> 00:07:52,890
do this over and over again shift D and

196
00:07:52,890 --> 00:07:54,840
then I'm position at reposition the tire

197
00:07:54,840 --> 00:07:58,050
this is no particular order that I have

198
00:07:58,050 --> 00:08:01,200
to do this I just went off just random

199
00:08:01,200 --> 00:08:04,980
basically duplicating these tires then I

200
00:08:04,980 --> 00:08:06,450
move them up a little bit to try to

201
00:08:06,450 --> 00:08:08,910
create some some sort of a stack of

202
00:08:08,910 --> 00:08:12,930
tires for a stash boss - normal stash a

203
00:08:12,930 --> 00:08:14,669
stash of tires I rotate them a little

204
00:08:14,669 --> 00:08:16,410
bit as well to keep a bit of an

205
00:08:16,410 --> 00:08:18,360
inconsistent look so it looks like

206
00:08:18,360 --> 00:08:20,250
they've just been thrown a bunch of

207
00:08:20,250 --> 00:08:21,570
tires on to there so I'll fast forward

208
00:08:21,570 --> 00:08:23,669
this part because it's basically just a

209
00:08:23,669 --> 00:08:26,850
bunch of shift DS and R to rotate them

210
00:08:26,850 --> 00:08:29,220
and then I try to place them so it looks

211
00:08:29,220 --> 00:08:30,870
decent it's not too picky to be honest

212
00:08:30,870 --> 00:08:33,780
just do it whatever way you feel it then

213
00:08:33,780 --> 00:08:35,549
I wanted to add some straps to hold this

214
00:08:35,549 --> 00:08:37,260
into place they look a bit weird if you

215
00:08:37,260 --> 00:08:39,089
hit that and the tires didn't go flying

216
00:08:39,089 --> 00:08:41,099
all over the place I hit shift a and

217
00:08:41,099 --> 00:08:42,039
added a new mesh

218
00:08:42,039 --> 00:08:44,078
and I added a plane this time press 1 on

219
00:08:44,078 --> 00:08:46,389
the keyboard to enter vertex mode and

220
00:08:46,389 --> 00:08:48,370
then I can move the vertices into place

221
00:08:48,370 --> 00:08:50,889
make sure you have vertex snapping on

222
00:08:50,889 --> 00:08:52,959
because then it makes it easy to hold

223
00:08:52,959 --> 00:08:54,970
the ctrl key and you can snap that to

224
00:08:54,970 --> 00:08:56,800
the vertices of the other object which

225
00:08:56,800 --> 00:08:58,779
is the tire object in this case I just

226
00:08:58,779 --> 00:09:00,940
hold the control key and I move the

227
00:09:00,940 --> 00:09:03,130
vertices so it snaps - pretty good

228
00:09:03,130 --> 00:09:06,639
places onto the other tires go into edge

229
00:09:06,639 --> 00:09:08,560
mode and then select the edge and hit e

230
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,870
to extrude upon and now you just repeat

231
00:09:10,870 --> 00:09:12,790
the process of moving the vertices with

232
00:09:12,790 --> 00:09:14,740
the ctrl key and then you extrude again

233
00:09:14,740 --> 00:09:16,839
and you keep doing that until you wrap

234
00:09:16,839 --> 00:09:18,940
your new mesh around the tires so you

235
00:09:18,940 --> 00:09:20,350
get something that looks a bit like a

236
00:09:20,350 --> 00:09:22,360
strap around it and that fits a little

237
00:09:22,360 --> 00:09:23,949
bit snug around it I'll just fast

238
00:09:23,949 --> 00:09:26,050
forward this again I do all T as well to

239
00:09:26,050 --> 00:09:28,389
extrude the faces along the normals so I

240
00:09:28,389 --> 00:09:30,279
get a bit of volume to the strap so they

241
00:09:30,279 --> 00:09:32,050
don't cut through that'll expand the

242
00:09:32,050 --> 00:09:33,970
strap out and then I fast forward a

243
00:09:33,970 --> 00:09:35,259
little bit again because I added a

244
00:09:35,259 --> 00:09:36,819
vertical strap I thought that would look

245
00:09:36,819 --> 00:09:38,380
a little bit better as well to keep them

246
00:09:38,380 --> 00:09:40,589
in place

247
00:09:41,250 --> 00:09:43,630
now we're gonna create a fence and as

248
00:09:43,630 --> 00:09:45,220
you can see it doesn't break on light

249
00:09:45,220 --> 00:09:47,139
impacts like the red car or the little

250
00:09:47,139 --> 00:09:49,540
racecar did but when the police car

251
00:09:49,540 --> 00:09:52,480
comes and those are 90 then it will last

252
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,310
up there it doesn't have to be the

253
00:09:54,310 --> 00:09:56,019
police car but then the fences break

254
00:09:56,019 --> 00:09:58,420
anyway so what I ended up doing is I

255
00:09:58,420 --> 00:09:59,949
created a simple fence so you have to

256
00:09:59,949 --> 00:10:02,589
make sure that the geometry sticks down

257
00:10:02,589 --> 00:10:08,740
a little bit on the ground then I made

258
00:10:08,740 --> 00:10:11,319
it 2 meters long so it'll be nice to

259
00:10:11,319 --> 00:10:13,510
snap it or nice and easy to snap it in

260
00:10:13,510 --> 00:10:15,370
place in unity because if you're all the

261
00:10:15,370 --> 00:10:17,470
control to keen unity you can also snap

262
00:10:17,470 --> 00:10:21,069
in there this is how I made it basically

263
00:10:21,069 --> 00:10:22,810
I just had a starter from a cube and

264
00:10:22,810 --> 00:10:24,819
then I extruded it I made a bunch of

265
00:10:24,819 --> 00:10:27,519
blue cuts and I in such a few of their

266
00:10:27,519 --> 00:10:31,029
faces and then I extruded the inset hold

267
00:10:31,029 --> 00:10:32,829
the control key to snap it into place

268
00:10:32,829 --> 00:10:36,010
I actually adjusted it to make sure that

269
00:10:36,010 --> 00:10:39,310
it was exactly 2 meters the reason why I

270
00:10:39,310 --> 00:10:41,800
created a separate fence post as well is

271
00:10:41,800 --> 00:10:43,630
because when you duplicate objects in

272
00:10:43,630 --> 00:10:45,459
unity in particular you shouldn't have a

273
00:10:45,459 --> 00:10:47,889
lot of additional geometry so if you add

274
00:10:47,889 --> 00:10:49,899
two thousand all they'll be duplicating

275
00:10:49,899 --> 00:10:51,699
all the fence posts so what ended up

276
00:10:51,699 --> 00:10:53,740
doing here is I just created a separate

277
00:10:53,740 --> 00:10:54,970
post so I can do that

278
00:10:54,970 --> 00:10:56,589
endings quite nice now we're gonna

279
00:10:56,589 --> 00:10:58,509
create a police station and it's only

280
00:10:58,509 --> 00:11:00,550
gonna be used for decoration but that's

281
00:11:00,550 --> 00:11:03,069
for now I'm probably gonna use use it so

282
00:11:03,069 --> 00:11:04,839
the police car will come out of it later

283
00:11:04,839 --> 00:11:06,339
on as well and chase you I don't know

284
00:11:06,339 --> 00:11:07,930
why it would be a police car and buy a

285
00:11:07,930 --> 00:11:10,360
racetrack maybe he's here eating Donuts

286
00:11:10,360 --> 00:11:12,579
having a good time and then racecars go

287
00:11:12,579 --> 00:11:14,800
past he's gotta have some of the case

288
00:11:14,800 --> 00:11:16,899
I'll just fast forward this this uses

289
00:11:16,899 --> 00:11:18,610
all the normal techniques that I use in

290
00:11:18,610 --> 00:11:20,470
my 10 minute modeling challenges and

291
00:11:20,470 --> 00:11:22,810
also in my tutorials my if you want to

292
00:11:22,810 --> 00:11:25,509
check out the 20 tips for blender low

293
00:11:25,509 --> 00:11:27,519
poly modeling for example check out the

294
00:11:27,519 --> 00:11:29,980
link in the description below and you

295
00:11:29,980 --> 00:11:32,019
can see the techniques it's a lot of e

296
00:11:32,019 --> 00:11:34,000
to extrude as to scale if you know me by

297
00:11:34,000 --> 00:11:38,290
now and also inserts a very common thing

298
00:11:38,290 --> 00:11:41,110
that I use and control are for a bunch

299
00:11:41,110 --> 00:11:43,029
of loot cuts and also use the UV

300
00:11:43,029 --> 00:11:45,100
coloring technique that I've used for

301
00:11:45,100 --> 00:11:47,560
the cars to give the police stations and

302
00:11:47,560 --> 00:11:50,040
color

303
00:12:00,240 --> 00:12:02,860
now we're gonna create some trees and I

304
00:12:02,860 --> 00:12:04,750
start from a primitive cube again and I

305
00:12:04,750 --> 00:12:07,089
colorize it brown and then it's a again

306
00:12:07,089 --> 00:12:09,430
a matter of extruding it and hitting our

307
00:12:09,430 --> 00:12:11,139
to rotate it when you hit our you can

308
00:12:11,139 --> 00:12:13,089
press the axis that you want to rotate

309
00:12:13,089 --> 00:12:15,040
there rounds of the Zed axis for example

310
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:17,050
then it'll force a rotation around the z

311
00:12:17,050 --> 00:12:19,300
axis I'll fast forward this it uses the

312
00:12:19,300 --> 00:12:21,310
exact same techniques as I always do

313
00:12:21,310 --> 00:12:23,589
when I model so it's probably gonna bore

314
00:12:23,589 --> 00:12:25,540
you if I do this in real time in another

315
00:12:25,540 --> 00:12:27,129
game that I made before that I never

316
00:12:27,129 --> 00:12:29,649
finished but you can animate these trees

317
00:12:29,649 --> 00:12:31,209
quite nicely so I'll probably add that

318
00:12:31,209 --> 00:12:33,550
later on in a shader as well so that

319
00:12:33,550 --> 00:12:35,470
that would be shader driven inside of

320
00:12:35,470 --> 00:12:36,970
unity and you can actually have the

321
00:12:36,970 --> 00:12:38,620
graphics card animate the trees without

322
00:12:38,620 --> 00:12:41,259
any performance impact whatsoever it's

323
00:12:41,259 --> 00:12:41,860
really good

324
00:12:41,860 --> 00:12:43,870
so I'll be able to show that I've got a

325
00:12:43,870 --> 00:12:45,970
video in my history if you can be

326
00:12:45,970 --> 00:12:47,500
bothered to look back long enough in my

327
00:12:47,500 --> 00:12:48,910
history you can see that already but

328
00:12:48,910 --> 00:12:50,519
I'll probably make a new one for that I

329
00:12:50,519 --> 00:12:52,899
use a lot of the proportional editing

330
00:12:52,899 --> 00:12:55,089
when I model trees and stones and things

331
00:12:55,089 --> 00:12:57,009
like that so that's all on the keyboard

332
00:12:57,009 --> 00:12:59,470
and you make use of that it's really

333
00:12:59,470 --> 00:13:04,019
handy to shift the shape of the tree

334
00:13:35,399 --> 00:13:37,870
all right then I separate the trees and

335
00:13:37,870 --> 00:13:40,000
make them into individual objects I just

336
00:13:40,000 --> 00:13:42,639
select all the vertices and I hit P to

337
00:13:42,639 --> 00:13:44,800
separate the selection into an object I

338
00:13:44,800 --> 00:13:48,160
always like to export them as separate

339
00:13:48,160 --> 00:13:50,320
objects by the time they end up inside

340
00:13:50,320 --> 00:13:51,880
of unity it's nice to have them

341
00:13:51,880 --> 00:13:54,550
separated and set to the center of the

342
00:13:54,550 --> 00:13:58,899
scene don't be afraid if the scene looks

343
00:13:58,899 --> 00:14:01,029
a bit messy I've got loads of geometry

344
00:14:01,029 --> 00:14:02,440
and trees you can always hide them

345
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:04,510
select the object select the geometry

346
00:14:04,510 --> 00:14:08,620
and press H to hide it so set the tree

347
00:14:08,620 --> 00:14:10,300
origin as well to the pivot point it's

348
00:14:10,300 --> 00:14:12,399
really important that it's at the base

349
00:14:12,399 --> 00:14:13,810
of the tree but to have some geometry

350
00:14:13,810 --> 00:14:15,670
that sticks down on the ground as well

351
00:14:15,670 --> 00:14:17,740
just a little tiny bit it makes it super

352
00:14:17,740 --> 00:14:19,540
easy to place them inside of unity

353
00:14:19,540 --> 00:14:21,519
because when you drag the trees out into

354
00:14:21,519 --> 00:14:23,529
the scene they'll automatically use the

355
00:14:23,529 --> 00:14:25,120
pivot point towards the center point of

356
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,430
the tree to place itself if you place it

357
00:14:27,430 --> 00:14:29,319
as a prefab it's really good inside of

358
00:14:29,319 --> 00:14:32,410
unity to have it like that then make

359
00:14:32,410 --> 00:14:33,910
sure you name the objects properly as

360
00:14:33,910 --> 00:14:35,589
well the name that you give them in here

361
00:14:35,589 --> 00:14:37,569
in blender is what they'll end up having

362
00:14:37,569 --> 00:14:39,370
inside of unity when you import them the

363
00:14:39,370 --> 00:14:41,560
mesh name will be so trying to keep a

364
00:14:41,560 --> 00:14:43,750
good naming standard there you can move

365
00:14:43,750 --> 00:14:46,480
their objects as I mentioned into Oracle

366
00:14:46,480 --> 00:14:49,510
or is zero zero zero if you select an

367
00:14:49,510 --> 00:14:51,519
object and hit alt G that does that

368
00:14:51,519 --> 00:14:53,079
automatically for you it resets the

369
00:14:53,079 --> 00:14:54,730
transform and it's a really quick way to

370
00:14:54,730 --> 00:14:56,949
move objects from wherever they are in

371
00:14:56,949 --> 00:14:59,170
the blender scene to the center of the

372
00:14:59,170 --> 00:15:00,550
scene which is really nice when you

373
00:15:00,550 --> 00:15:02,440
export them as I mentioned it's nice to

374
00:15:02,440 --> 00:15:05,470
have them in zero zero zero XYZ I have

375
00:15:05,470 --> 00:15:07,449
some problems with a car so I had to fix

376
00:15:07,449 --> 00:15:09,639
them I had some inverted faces so if

377
00:15:09,639 --> 00:15:10,810
you've downloaded those you'll probably

378
00:15:10,810 --> 00:15:12,519
notice that if you have back face

379
00:15:12,519 --> 00:15:16,149
culling this enabled and I had to fix

380
00:15:16,149 --> 00:15:17,649
that for the game because unity doesn't

381
00:15:17,649 --> 00:15:19,899
render with the back faces of objects

382
00:15:19,899 --> 00:15:21,910
unless you tell it to and I don't really

383
00:15:21,910 --> 00:15:22,960
like to have

384
00:15:22,960 --> 00:15:26,030
some of the faces inverted so I have to

385
00:15:26,030 --> 00:15:28,490
fix that by and I enable all the cars in

386
00:15:28,490 --> 00:15:30,230
the scene because you can do that for

387
00:15:30,230 --> 00:15:31,910
all of them at the same time and then I

388
00:15:31,910 --> 00:15:34,250
select all the car objects in the scene

389
00:15:34,250 --> 00:15:36,740
and then I press tab to go into edit

390
00:15:36,740 --> 00:15:38,030
mode for all of them at the same time

391
00:15:38,030 --> 00:15:41,540
and now I can hit L on the keyboard to

392
00:15:41,540 --> 00:15:43,430
select the link faces and it was a bit

393
00:15:43,430 --> 00:15:45,050
tedious here because I had to hover the

394
00:15:45,050 --> 00:15:46,640
mouse over each element that was

395
00:15:46,640 --> 00:15:48,710
inverted so all the door handles all the

396
00:15:48,710 --> 00:15:51,680
rearview mirrors all the windscreen not

397
00:15:51,680 --> 00:15:53,030
the windscreen but the bumpers and

398
00:15:53,030 --> 00:15:54,890
things so I had to do that for all the

399
00:15:54,890 --> 00:15:57,440
cars and hit L and select all of them

400
00:15:57,440 --> 00:15:59,300
and when you've done that hit f3 on the

401
00:15:59,300 --> 00:16:02,090
keyboard and type in flip normals and

402
00:16:02,090 --> 00:16:03,620
when you apply that one it will flip all

403
00:16:03,620 --> 00:16:05,360
the faces so the back faces are no

404
00:16:05,360 --> 00:16:07,250
longer facing outwards they'll be facing

405
00:16:07,250 --> 00:16:09,320
inwards like this should be so now the

406
00:16:09,320 --> 00:16:11,750
cars are fixed I should mention that the

407
00:16:11,750 --> 00:16:13,160
pickup had some problems with the wheel

408
00:16:13,160 --> 00:16:15,710
arches but it was quite a long fix so I

409
00:16:15,710 --> 00:16:17,630
had to cut that out for this video then

410
00:16:17,630 --> 00:16:19,400
it's time to detach the wheels they have

411
00:16:19,400 --> 00:16:21,110
to be separate objects when you're

412
00:16:21,110 --> 00:16:22,970
bringing it into unity because the car

413
00:16:22,970 --> 00:16:24,620
chassis is gonna be one thing and then

414
00:16:24,620 --> 00:16:26,120
the wheels have to be separate so I

415
00:16:26,120 --> 00:16:28,010
basically zoom into one of the cars and

416
00:16:28,010 --> 00:16:30,470
then I hit L again when I hover over the

417
00:16:30,470 --> 00:16:32,150
wheel and I select the link to vertices

418
00:16:32,150 --> 00:16:34,970
and then I had shift D to to touch the

419
00:16:34,970 --> 00:16:37,040
selection into a separate object I

420
00:16:37,040 --> 00:16:39,170
rename it to wheel because that's the

421
00:16:39,170 --> 00:16:40,790
name it'll have in the unity later on

422
00:16:40,790 --> 00:16:43,280
and then I take away the mirror modifier

423
00:16:43,280 --> 00:16:46,670
we only need one wheel and I wanted to

424
00:16:46,670 --> 00:16:48,560
tidy up the geometry because I wanted to

425
00:16:48,560 --> 00:16:50,630
be able to see through the wheel so in

426
00:16:50,630 --> 00:16:52,430
the quick build I only kept the full

427
00:16:52,430 --> 00:16:55,990
face inside so I do some editing here by

428
00:16:55,990 --> 00:16:58,460
inserting the inner inner side and

429
00:16:58,460 --> 00:17:00,500
extruding inwards using the normal

430
00:17:00,500 --> 00:17:02,120
techniques that I always do for my

431
00:17:02,120 --> 00:17:03,770
editing so there's no probably no

432
00:17:03,770 --> 00:17:05,990
different things here really - compared

433
00:17:05,990 --> 00:17:07,910
to what I normally do right you can hit

434
00:17:07,910 --> 00:17:10,250
F to create a face so when you've

435
00:17:10,250 --> 00:17:12,319
selected a bunch of edges then if you

436
00:17:12,319 --> 00:17:14,990
had the F key it'll fill that gap and

437
00:17:14,990 --> 00:17:17,510
create a face for you alright if you

438
00:17:17,510 --> 00:17:19,609
have to alt and left Mouse it'll ring

439
00:17:19,609 --> 00:17:21,710
select a bunch of edges and then I hit

440
00:17:21,710 --> 00:17:24,589
again to fill that as well or fill that

441
00:17:24,589 --> 00:17:25,790
gap

442
00:17:25,790 --> 00:17:27,839
alright I'll just fast forward again

443
00:17:27,839 --> 00:17:29,730
it's the same type of editing so you're

444
00:17:29,730 --> 00:17:31,320
probably fed up with that now but I

445
00:17:31,320 --> 00:17:32,730
colorized it so it looked a bit like a

446
00:17:32,730 --> 00:17:34,830
rim inside and then I just made sure it

447
00:17:34,830 --> 00:17:36,960
connected on both ends hold the control

448
00:17:36,960 --> 00:17:39,060
key to stop those viruses into place and

449
00:17:39,060 --> 00:17:42,600
and merge them together that's it the

450
00:17:42,600 --> 00:17:44,550
wheel is done and now I had to delete

451
00:17:44,550 --> 00:17:47,160
the wheel so for all the cars they don't

452
00:17:47,160 --> 00:17:48,900
need any wheels on them when I export

453
00:17:48,900 --> 00:17:51,120
them so I make sure I do it for all the

454
00:17:51,120 --> 00:17:53,130
cars so I'll fast forward this again as

455
00:17:53,130 --> 00:17:56,040
well and just hit L on the keyboard over

456
00:17:56,040 --> 00:17:57,870
all the wheels and then delete the

457
00:17:57,870 --> 00:18:00,420
vertices and now it's time to create the

458
00:18:00,420 --> 00:18:02,580
unity project finally and we will spend

459
00:18:02,580 --> 00:18:04,230
a little time here we have to do export

460
00:18:04,230 --> 00:18:05,670
a few more objects in blender as well

461
00:18:05,670 --> 00:18:08,460
but finally I'm just creating a new in

462
00:18:08,460 --> 00:18:11,700
unity 2019 whatever version so I do a 3d

463
00:18:11,700 --> 00:18:13,890
project and I just name it appropriately

464
00:18:13,890 --> 00:18:16,680
I decided to call it low poly racer and

465
00:18:16,680 --> 00:18:19,620
then I just create a blank unity project

466
00:18:19,620 --> 00:18:22,260
from that alright when you're inside

467
00:18:22,260 --> 00:18:24,390
unity rename the sample scene it's nice

468
00:18:24,390 --> 00:18:26,520
to not have it named sample scene so I

469
00:18:26,520 --> 00:18:28,790
rename it to game

470
00:18:28,790 --> 00:18:31,730
[Music]

471
00:18:31,730 --> 00:18:34,100
I have to switch back into blender

472
00:18:34,100 --> 00:18:35,600
because we're going to export the FBX

473
00:18:35,600 --> 00:18:36,860
file sorry it's just a little bit more

474
00:18:36,860 --> 00:18:39,050
blender first so I'll either show all

475
00:18:39,050 --> 00:18:40,220
the cars at once

476
00:18:40,220 --> 00:18:41,780
I just unhide them by clicking the eye

477
00:18:41,780 --> 00:18:44,330
icon and I export all of the cars into

478
00:18:44,330 --> 00:18:46,370
one single FBX file you could have them

479
00:18:46,370 --> 00:18:47,990
multiple but just thought it was simple

480
00:18:47,990 --> 00:18:49,700
enough to export them all into one file

481
00:18:49,700 --> 00:18:51,770
they all have to be centered so I had to

482
00:18:51,770 --> 00:18:54,140
reposition the center point and I do

483
00:18:54,140 --> 00:18:56,120
that by just going into the object

484
00:18:56,120 --> 00:18:58,340
selecting all the vertices and sliding

485
00:18:58,340 --> 00:19:00,170
it into place or the center point of the

486
00:19:00,170 --> 00:19:02,780
object is in the center of the car it

487
00:19:02,780 --> 00:19:04,220
can be at the base of the car that's

488
00:19:04,220 --> 00:19:06,950
fine but it has to be center so it

489
00:19:06,950 --> 00:19:09,620
pivots around its own center point that

490
00:19:09,620 --> 00:19:11,360
would be save you a lot of hassle inside

491
00:19:11,360 --> 00:19:21,380
of unity later on in object mode select

492
00:19:21,380 --> 00:19:23,780
all the cars and now it's time to export

493
00:19:23,780 --> 00:19:30,460
them so go up to file and do export and

494
00:19:30,460 --> 00:19:35,210
select FBX files here are some really

495
00:19:35,210 --> 00:19:37,880
important settings you have to first of

496
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:39,320
all if you've selected the objects you

497
00:19:39,320 --> 00:19:41,450
need to take select selected objects we

498
00:19:41,450 --> 00:19:42,950
don't want to export everything that's

499
00:19:42,950 --> 00:19:44,570
in this scene so that's really important

500
00:19:44,570 --> 00:19:46,370
if you have multiple scenes and lights

501
00:19:46,370 --> 00:19:47,210
and things like that

502
00:19:47,210 --> 00:19:49,700
another one is apply scalings set that

503
00:19:49,700 --> 00:19:51,980
to FBX unit scale and because that will

504
00:19:51,980 --> 00:19:54,470
make one meter in blender will be one

505
00:19:54,470 --> 00:19:56,390
meter in unity so it's really handy that

506
00:19:56,390 --> 00:19:58,730
the scales are the same and the last

507
00:19:58,730 --> 00:20:00,020
thing we need to do is take this

508
00:20:00,020 --> 00:20:02,540
experimental apply transform again

509
00:20:02,540 --> 00:20:04,100
because then the rotation will be

510
00:20:04,100 --> 00:20:05,810
correct in unity otherwise the objects

511
00:20:05,810 --> 00:20:07,340
they look like they're correct but

512
00:20:07,340 --> 00:20:08,780
they're actually flipped 90 degrees

513
00:20:08,780 --> 00:20:10,790
around the x-axis unless you do that so

514
00:20:10,790 --> 00:20:12,710
because they use different up and down

515
00:20:12,710 --> 00:20:14,990
axis navigate to a folder I actually

516
00:20:14,990 --> 00:20:17,000
like to save it straight into the assets

517
00:20:17,000 --> 00:20:18,740
folder because then unity will

518
00:20:18,740 --> 00:20:21,350
automatically import it for you so I

519
00:20:21,350 --> 00:20:23,420
create a new folder there that I like to

520
00:20:23,420 --> 00:20:25,100
call meshes to keep it tidy

521
00:20:25,100 --> 00:20:26,870
so bone is as well if you want to make

522
00:20:26,870 --> 00:20:28,820
changes to a mesh you can just save over

523
00:20:28,820 --> 00:20:30,650
the old FBX file and it'll automatically

524
00:20:30,650 --> 00:20:32,090
import it but be careful if you have

525
00:20:32,090 --> 00:20:34,040
animations in there because then you

526
00:20:34,040 --> 00:20:37,630
have to redo some of the workflows

527
00:20:39,870 --> 00:20:43,360
hit the export file and now you've got

528
00:20:43,360 --> 00:20:47,559
your cars exporting them I'm gonna hide

529
00:20:47,559 --> 00:20:49,510
the cars and show the wheel instead

530
00:20:49,510 --> 00:20:51,160
because it's time to export the wheel as

531
00:20:51,160 --> 00:20:54,870
well I mean need that in unity as well

532
00:20:54,870 --> 00:20:57,490
make sure the pivot point is in the

533
00:20:57,490 --> 00:20:58,750
center of the wheel you don't want to

534
00:20:58,750 --> 00:21:01,299
have a wheel that that rotates around

535
00:21:01,299 --> 00:21:04,510
it's some other weird axis so first I

536
00:21:04,510 --> 00:21:06,610
moved it manually and for some reason I

537
00:21:06,610 --> 00:21:09,309
forgot to that just hit f3 type set

538
00:21:09,309 --> 00:21:12,549
origin and then do you can have a really

539
00:21:12,549 --> 00:21:13,840
nice way to do what I did before

540
00:21:13,840 --> 00:21:15,700
actually with some of the objects it's

541
00:21:15,700 --> 00:21:19,710
the origin to center of mass

542
00:21:25,310 --> 00:21:27,840
then it's time to export the wheel same

543
00:21:27,840 --> 00:21:29,910
settings as before really important to

544
00:21:29,910 --> 00:21:37,110
keep those and then I forgot to change

545
00:21:37,110 --> 00:21:39,060
the name here so I overrode the course

546
00:21:39,060 --> 00:21:41,220
but that's no panic I do that all the

547
00:21:41,220 --> 00:21:43,590
time just have to redo it but I'll spare

548
00:21:43,590 --> 00:21:45,240
you the time and now the cars are

549
00:21:45,240 --> 00:21:46,890
already in unity because we saved them

550
00:21:46,890 --> 00:21:48,420
in the asset folder so that's really

551
00:21:48,420 --> 00:21:51,150
handy so if you expand the meshes folder

552
00:21:51,150 --> 00:21:52,560
now you'll see that there's a new object

553
00:21:52,560 --> 00:21:55,320
called cars and all the car meshes as

554
00:21:55,320 --> 00:21:58,170
you can see are in the same FBX file

555
00:21:58,170 --> 00:22:00,630
here I like to go into material and

556
00:22:00,630 --> 00:22:02,610
disable import materials and apply

557
00:22:02,610 --> 00:22:04,020
because we want to create our own

558
00:22:04,020 --> 00:22:06,630
material instead so I create a new

559
00:22:06,630 --> 00:22:09,180
folder then I call it textures and then

560
00:22:09,180 --> 00:22:11,040
I dragged the texture in that we used in

561
00:22:11,040 --> 00:22:14,580
blender into this texture folder and

562
00:22:14,580 --> 00:22:16,530
after that I create a new folder again

563
00:22:16,530 --> 00:22:18,510
and I named it materials I like to keep

564
00:22:18,510 --> 00:22:20,460
it tightly like that and then I create a

565
00:22:20,460 --> 00:22:22,380
new material there and I call it common

566
00:22:22,380 --> 00:22:24,510
because most objects actually will be

567
00:22:24,510 --> 00:22:26,280
using this one since I often use the

568
00:22:26,280 --> 00:22:30,180
same palette drag the texture that we've

569
00:22:30,180 --> 00:22:32,310
brought in before to the albedo slot and

570
00:22:32,310 --> 00:22:34,230
notice now that the texture looks really

571
00:22:34,230 --> 00:22:35,610
blurry that's no good

572
00:22:35,610 --> 00:22:37,890
we don't we can't have it like that so

573
00:22:37,890 --> 00:22:39,510
we need to change a few settings so

574
00:22:39,510 --> 00:22:41,550
click on the texture and then you have

575
00:22:41,550 --> 00:22:44,400
to change this compression you set it to

576
00:22:44,400 --> 00:22:46,880
none otherwise it'll be wrong colors and

577
00:22:46,880 --> 00:22:49,770
also the filter mode you have to change

578
00:22:49,770 --> 00:22:52,470
the point otherwise because it will be

579
00:22:52,470 --> 00:22:54,210
very wrong and then you have to apply

580
00:22:54,210 --> 00:22:57,690
the changes as well now when you look

581
00:22:57,690 --> 00:22:59,490
here the texture looks a lot better just

582
00:22:59,490 --> 00:23:01,560
like we used it and then I reduce the

583
00:23:01,560 --> 00:23:03,960
smoothness slider so I like to keep

584
00:23:03,960 --> 00:23:05,910
their reflections a bit lower and now

585
00:23:05,910 --> 00:23:07,860
we're gonna drag the cars object into

586
00:23:07,860 --> 00:23:10,560
the hierarchy and then I expand it and

587
00:23:10,560 --> 00:23:13,230
select all the cars and then I drag the

588
00:23:13,230 --> 00:23:15,840
common material onto the elements 0 of

589
00:23:15,840 --> 00:23:17,460
the materials and that'll give all the

590
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:19,800
cars the proper colors and then I do

591
00:23:19,800 --> 00:23:22,320
unpack prefabs completely if you right

592
00:23:22,320 --> 00:23:24,360
click on it and then I drag all the

593
00:23:24,360 --> 00:23:26,100
objects into the route scene and I

594
00:23:26,100 --> 00:23:28,200
delete the original cars folder now

595
00:23:28,200 --> 00:23:30,210
we're all set actually for episode

596
00:23:30,210 --> 00:23:31,620
number 3 this is gonna be the end of

597
00:23:31,620 --> 00:23:33,180
this one a lot of their blender stuff

598
00:23:33,180 --> 00:23:34,560
and the housekeeping and doing the

599
00:23:34,560 --> 00:23:35,970
exports and things like that but don't

600
00:23:35,970 --> 00:23:37,770
worry next week we will be doing a lot

601
00:23:37,770 --> 00:23:37,960
of

602
00:23:37,960 --> 00:23:39,820
stuff in unity we're gonna actually get

603
00:23:39,820 --> 00:23:41,169
these car we're gonna get the wheels

604
00:23:41,169 --> 00:23:43,059
mounted we're gonna got the wheel

605
00:23:43,059 --> 00:23:44,620
colliders have touched we're gonna have

606
00:23:44,620 --> 00:23:46,720
them drive spin the wheels we're gonna

607
00:23:46,720 --> 00:23:48,399
have them steer check out these clips

608
00:23:48,399 --> 00:23:51,370
guys we filmed these in 2005 on a lake

609
00:23:51,370 --> 00:23:54,630
not too far away from here

610
00:24:16,360 --> 00:24:19,280
we bought a bunch of old Volvo's Volvo

611
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:22,280
240 my friend add I had a Volvo 360 we

612
00:24:22,280 --> 00:24:24,169
bought some old rally tires with spikes

613
00:24:24,169 --> 00:24:26,330
about that long got the mounted drove

614
00:24:26,330 --> 00:24:28,130
over to the lake and we paid a guy there

615
00:24:28,130 --> 00:24:30,380
who plowed the track on the lake with a

616
00:24:30,380 --> 00:24:32,299
little plow just like that now any

617
00:24:32,299 --> 00:24:33,710
protective gear or anything I thought I

618
00:24:33,710 --> 00:24:36,500
was just stupid but the water started to

619
00:24:36,500 --> 00:24:38,299
leak up in some of the corners and all

620
00:24:38,299 --> 00:24:40,130
we did was like we paid the guy a little

621
00:24:40,130 --> 00:24:42,679
few more extra Swedish kronor to plow a

622
00:24:42,679 --> 00:24:44,360
new track for us so we didn't have to

623
00:24:44,360 --> 00:24:47,750
wait to get the cars wet those alright

624
00:24:47,750 --> 00:24:49,640
enough about that it was a fun time

625
00:24:49,640 --> 00:24:52,340

that YouTube algorithm and make it blow

631
00:25:02,270 --> 00:25:03,799
up again like just like the last one I

632
00:25:03,799 --> 00:25:04,730
