00:00:00,000 --> 00:00:02,520
hi guys this stefan fashion also known

2
00:00:02,520 --> 00:00:03,270
as infancia

3
00:00:03,270 --> 00:00:04,950
and i'm making a game called that's

4
00:00:04,950 --> 00:00:06,960
racing which is a low polygon racing

5
00:00:06,960 --> 00:00:08,940
game and for that game I'm gonna need a

6
00:00:08,940 --> 00:00:11,250
lot of low poly trees and I've started

7
00:00:11,250 --> 00:00:12,750
to make some in blender here and I

8
00:00:12,750 --> 00:00:14,460
wanted to go through the process of how

9
00:00:14,460 --> 00:00:15,960
I make them and maybe I can share some

10
00:00:15,960 --> 00:00:17,640
tips and tricks on how you can make your

11
00:00:17,640 --> 00:00:19,890
own polygon trees and I'll also bring

12
00:00:19,890 --> 00:00:21,900
them into unity and show you some of the

13
00:00:21,900 --> 00:00:23,430
shader effects that you can apply to get

14
00:00:23,430 --> 00:00:24,779
them to sway a little bit in the wind

15
00:00:24,779 --> 00:00:26,490
and also add some weather effects to

16
00:00:26,490 --> 00:00:29,400
them so as you can see here already got

17
00:00:29,400 --> 00:00:32,520
got a bunch of trees and I've been able

18
00:00:32,520 --> 00:00:34,140
to screencast keys here so you should be

19
00:00:34,140 --> 00:00:35,520
able to see all the keystrokes that I do

20
00:00:35,520 --> 00:00:37,590
and I'm gonna be trying to say them all

21
00:00:37,590 --> 00:00:40,110
out loud as well and I'm by no means a

22
00:00:40,110 --> 00:00:42,510
blender expert so bear with me when I

23
00:00:42,510 --> 00:00:45,870
hit the wrong Keys all the time but just

24
00:00:45,870 --> 00:00:47,879
gonna have to live with it maybe I'll

25
00:00:47,879 --> 00:00:49,469
try to edit some of it out as well but

26
00:00:49,469 --> 00:00:51,960
what's huh let's see how it goes so as

27
00:00:51,960 --> 00:00:53,370
you can see I've made a bunch of trees

28
00:00:53,370 --> 00:00:56,070
here and I've also got a whole bunch of

29
00:00:56,070 --> 00:00:58,079
tree trunks here that I'm going to be

30
00:00:58,079 --> 00:01:02,550
adding foilage to later on and I but I

31
00:01:02,550 --> 00:01:04,500
will be making a tree from scratch so I

32
00:01:04,500 --> 00:01:06,000
can show you that a whole process here

33
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:10,530
and so I press shift C to get the cursor

34
00:01:10,530 --> 00:01:13,530
back into the center mode and then I

35
00:01:13,530 --> 00:01:15,299
press the del key to get the rotation

36
00:01:15,299 --> 00:01:17,400
the way I want it and I'm also usually

37
00:01:17,400 --> 00:01:20,549
in orthographic mode which is when I

38
00:01:20,549 --> 00:01:24,450
make these trees rather than perspective

39
00:01:24,450 --> 00:01:27,390
so shift a to add a mesh and I always go

40
00:01:27,390 --> 00:01:32,640
start with a cube and let's go into the

41
00:01:32,640 --> 00:01:35,520
front view in orthographic and I also

42
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:37,110
want to make sure that trees that

43
00:01:37,110 --> 00:01:39,720
they're at the base so when you place it

44
00:01:39,720 --> 00:01:40,890
in the terrain it's gonna be a lot

45
00:01:40,890 --> 00:01:44,280
easier so I press tab and then I press s

46
00:01:44,280 --> 00:01:46,470
to scale it down a little bit to get a

47
00:01:46,470 --> 00:01:49,110
smaller stem and then I also want to

48
00:01:49,110 --> 00:01:50,970
move the bottom mesh here so I've got

49
00:01:50,970 --> 00:01:53,700
the face select here and I want to move

50
00:01:53,700 --> 00:01:57,570
that face up to is that zero to make

51
00:01:57,570 --> 00:01:59,850
sure that it's at the very base of the

52
00:01:59,850 --> 00:02:03,030
object at the pivot point and from there

53
00:02:03,030 --> 00:02:05,009
I might as well actually do the UV

54
00:02:05,009 --> 00:02:06,630
mapping here as well so I select all the

55
00:02:06,630 --> 00:02:09,330
faces and I go into the UV editing mode

56
00:02:09,330 --> 00:02:12,450
and I've already loaded this very simple

57
00:02:12,450 --> 00:02:13,590
pallet for a tree

58
00:02:13,590 --> 00:02:16,519
that I'm gonna be using and we clicked

59
00:02:16,519 --> 00:02:19,500
all meshes oops

60
00:02:19,500 --> 00:02:22,800
unwrap it just like this and since I'm

61
00:02:22,800 --> 00:02:25,140
not text you're mapping it I just want

62
00:02:25,140 --> 00:02:26,879
the colors from the texture so I just

63
00:02:26,879 --> 00:02:29,550
shrink all these meshes meshes or faces

64
00:02:29,550 --> 00:02:32,730
down and then I press G to grab it and

65
00:02:32,730 --> 00:02:34,290
then I move it into the center of the

66
00:02:34,290 --> 00:02:35,670
brown because this time it's gonna be

67
00:02:35,670 --> 00:02:37,200
brown at all times so that I have three

68
00:02:37,200 --> 00:02:39,650
different shades for the leaves later on

69
00:02:39,650 --> 00:02:42,989
and then I go back into the default mode

70
00:02:42,989 --> 00:02:46,049
and then we're gonna make a model a

71
00:02:46,049 --> 00:02:48,299
basic stem here so I make sure I'm in

72
00:02:48,299 --> 00:02:50,640
face mode here actually I'll go into

73
00:02:50,640 --> 00:02:52,140
perspective mode now I think which is

74
00:02:52,140 --> 00:02:55,019
long pod for five again and then I just

75
00:02:55,019 --> 00:02:57,989
work by extruding let's see I have to

76
00:02:57,989 --> 00:03:00,120
get this off this is the proportional

77
00:03:00,120 --> 00:03:01,769
editing which I don't want no it moves

78
00:03:01,769 --> 00:03:04,620
faces which are in in the neighborhood

79
00:03:04,620 --> 00:03:07,200
so I disable that and then basically I

80
00:03:07,200 --> 00:03:10,860
just exclude and I press the S key to

81
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:14,129
scale the face and then I can extrude

82
00:03:14,129 --> 00:03:17,069
again and then shrink that down a little

83
00:03:17,069 --> 00:03:19,980
bit and then basically I just work with

84
00:03:19,980 --> 00:03:23,430
the S key for scale and G for if I press

85
00:03:23,430 --> 00:03:25,109
D to grab I move it a little bit offset

86
00:03:25,109 --> 00:03:28,980
like that and then you can also click on

87
00:03:28,980 --> 00:03:31,730
these gizmo arrows to move it on a

88
00:03:31,730 --> 00:03:36,660
specific axis here so and then press key

89
00:03:36,660 --> 00:03:39,510
again to extrude up G to move it a

90
00:03:39,510 --> 00:03:41,639
little bit and then let's say here I

91
00:03:41,639 --> 00:03:43,620
come to a point where I want to split

92
00:03:43,620 --> 00:03:45,299
this into multiple branches and since I

93
00:03:45,299 --> 00:03:47,700
want the low-poly look I just do efore

94
00:03:47,700 --> 00:03:49,440
extrude again and I just go up a little

95
00:03:49,440 --> 00:03:51,989
bit like this because now I can grab a

96
00:03:51,989 --> 00:03:54,120
face here and then extrude this one with

97
00:03:54,120 --> 00:03:57,599
E and then I might move it a little bit

98
00:03:57,599 --> 00:03:59,340
and then maybe a little bit by using the

99
00:03:59,340 --> 00:04:04,220
axes and then s to scale and then also

100
00:04:04,220 --> 00:04:06,510
we can go on top here and mix through

101
00:04:06,510 --> 00:04:09,599
this one again scale and then I work

102
00:04:09,599 --> 00:04:13,709
like this and by just extruding the

103
00:04:13,709 --> 00:04:17,910
faces pressing G to grab them and move

104
00:04:17,910 --> 00:04:24,560
them basically extrude here grab scale

105
00:04:24,560 --> 00:04:29,490
grab let's move this one up a lot now

106
00:04:29,490 --> 00:04:31,169
let's say we want this one to move over

107
00:04:31,169 --> 00:04:34,020
a little bit more like this then also

108
00:04:34,020 --> 00:04:36,960
you can grab the bait out extra this one

109
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:38,490
again and then I'll split this into

110
00:04:38,490 --> 00:04:46,560
multiple branches here this scale grab

111
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:49,770
up and let's do one more here extrude

112
00:04:49,770 --> 00:04:57,060
with es4 scale this one up and here as

113
00:04:57,060 --> 00:04:58,710
well now you can grab a whole bunch of

114
00:04:58,710 --> 00:05:00,840
faces I like to work with that ctrl key

115
00:05:00,840 --> 00:05:04,620
I go into vertex select instead then I

116
00:05:04,620 --> 00:05:06,390
hold the ctrl key and then I can draw

117
00:05:06,390 --> 00:05:07,830
all the vertices that I want to select

118
00:05:07,830 --> 00:05:11,490
and I press R to rotate and as you can

119
00:05:11,490 --> 00:05:13,110
see now it didn't pick the back ones so

120
00:05:13,110 --> 00:05:13,800
I press esque

121
00:05:13,800 --> 00:05:15,659
escape to go out of that and I enable

122
00:05:15,659 --> 00:05:20,250
this one so now it also shows me the

123
00:05:20,250 --> 00:05:22,020
vertices that are behind and I redo this

124
00:05:22,020 --> 00:05:23,909
I press all to select a to select

125
00:05:23,909 --> 00:05:25,440
everything and a to deselect everything

126
00:05:25,440 --> 00:05:28,460
again is wrong so the ctrl key click

127
00:05:28,460 --> 00:05:31,110
drag around all the vertices I want and

128
00:05:31,110 --> 00:05:35,580
then R to rotate G to grab and move it a

129
00:05:35,580 --> 00:05:37,380
little bit again and then I basically

130
00:05:37,380 --> 00:05:39,069
just worked like this

131
00:05:39,069 --> 00:05:42,669
in different view modes just get an

132
00:05:42,669 --> 00:05:45,759
interesting tree look and then I can

133
00:05:45,759 --> 00:05:47,559
also do the same thing with a scale here

134
00:05:47,559 --> 00:05:50,409
and you can also set the if you want it

135
00:05:50,409 --> 00:05:56,319
to scale in a let's see if I press you

136
00:05:56,319 --> 00:05:58,449
see when I scale now it scales from the

137
00:05:58,449 --> 00:06:00,490
center of the object which I wouldn't

138
00:06:00,490 --> 00:06:01,930
want to do that if I scale a whole tree

139
00:06:01,930 --> 00:06:05,319
up so if I press the period key on the

140
00:06:05,319 --> 00:06:05,740
keyboard

141
00:06:05,740 --> 00:06:08,559
it changes the scaled center to the

142
00:06:08,559 --> 00:06:10,599
pivot point word to the yeah the pivot

143
00:06:10,599 --> 00:06:12,939
point of the object so if I scale now as

144
00:06:12,939 --> 00:06:14,319
you can see it grows the whole tree and

145
00:06:14,319 --> 00:06:15,969
it's also important to be in face mode

146
00:06:15,969 --> 00:06:18,099
here so with the tub so you can see the

147
00:06:18,099 --> 00:06:20,919
faces so you scale all the time within

148
00:06:20,919 --> 00:06:24,129
the this one because if I go out of edit

149
00:06:24,129 --> 00:06:26,020
mode it's important that this scale is

150
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:31,330
always 1 it makes it easier later on you

151
00:06:31,330 --> 00:06:33,219
can fix it later on as well but try to

152
00:06:33,219 --> 00:06:36,520
stick to keep it at one day so when you

153
00:06:36,520 --> 00:06:38,289
have a tree like this maybe that's all

154
00:06:38,289 --> 00:06:40,659
we want for this one and then we want to

155
00:06:40,659 --> 00:06:43,389
add this foilage look to it their leaves

156
00:06:43,389 --> 00:06:45,610
and there are a number of ways I do that

157
00:06:45,610 --> 00:06:48,039
but I'll take you through one of them

158
00:06:48,039 --> 00:06:54,309
for this particular tree and so I press

159
00:06:54,309 --> 00:06:55,990
tab to get out of the object mode and

160
00:06:55,990 --> 00:06:57,699
then I press a to deselect everything

161
00:06:57,699 --> 00:06:59,949
and then let's say I want to add I click

162
00:06:59,949 --> 00:07:01,479
on this face here and it'll put the

163
00:07:01,479 --> 00:07:03,699
cursor right there and then I press

164
00:07:03,699 --> 00:07:06,819
shift a to add in this case I'll add a

165
00:07:06,819 --> 00:07:10,569
cube and then I want to apply a modifier

166
00:07:10,569 --> 00:07:14,080
here which is the subdivision surface

167
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:17,740
and let's bring it up to 2 and that

168
00:07:17,740 --> 00:07:20,439
basically just creates a sphere cube map

169
00:07:20,439 --> 00:07:22,990
sphere and I like to work with different

170
00:07:22,990 --> 00:07:25,689
shapes you could have used this one

171
00:07:25,689 --> 00:07:27,639
called the ICO sphere for example which

172
00:07:27,639 --> 00:07:29,229
I use sometimes as well but for this

173
00:07:29,229 --> 00:07:31,349
case I'll just use the cube and

174
00:07:31,349 --> 00:07:35,649
subdivide it and then I click apply to

175
00:07:35,649 --> 00:07:38,019
get this mesh the way I want and then I

176
00:07:38,019 --> 00:07:41,409
press tab to go into edit mode face

177
00:07:41,409 --> 00:07:44,979
select a to select all the faces and

178
00:07:44,979 --> 00:07:49,529
then I go into the UV editing sorry

179
00:07:49,529 --> 00:07:54,249
and then I press on rap and again it

180
00:07:54,249 --> 00:07:56,139
doesn't matter that all the faces are

181
00:07:56,139 --> 00:07:58,360
showing like this because we're not

182
00:07:58,360 --> 00:07:59,379
going to text your map it in the

183
00:07:59,379 --> 00:08:01,719
traditional way way of UV doing UV

184
00:08:01,719 --> 00:08:04,180
Islands so I'll press s to scale this

185
00:08:04,180 --> 00:08:08,830
down let's do that again G to grab them

186
00:08:08,830 --> 00:08:10,479
and then I'll move them up just to get

187
00:08:10,479 --> 00:08:13,240
this solid green color there and then

188
00:08:13,240 --> 00:08:15,610
what I want to do is I want to go back

189
00:08:15,610 --> 00:08:19,120
into the default view here and then I

190
00:08:19,120 --> 00:08:21,629
can switch off the transparency there

191
00:08:21,629 --> 00:08:25,419
and then press a twice first to deselect

192
00:08:25,419 --> 00:08:27,430
everything and then again to select and

193
00:08:27,430 --> 00:08:29,529
then I press shift D to duplicate this

194
00:08:29,529 --> 00:08:34,539
and then I put this G to grab I want to

195
00:08:34,539 --> 00:08:38,250
place it just at the tip of that branch

196
00:08:38,250 --> 00:08:42,279
like this shift D again to duplicate and

197
00:08:42,279 --> 00:08:44,049
I'm this is I'm in the same object now

198
00:08:44,049 --> 00:08:45,550
this is still the same object I'm just

199
00:08:45,550 --> 00:08:47,589
duplicating all the mesh the vertices

200
00:08:47,589 --> 00:08:51,160
and the faces here I used G to grab it

201
00:08:51,160 --> 00:08:54,459
and move it into the place and then I

202
00:08:54,459 --> 00:08:57,819
press shift D again let's add that one

203
00:08:57,819 --> 00:09:02,199
up there G to grab it and move it a

204
00:09:02,199 --> 00:09:06,880
little bit and if I want to change now

205
00:09:06,880 --> 00:09:09,040
as you can see that this gizmo is

206
00:09:09,040 --> 00:09:10,600
controlling and that's because I used

207
00:09:10,600 --> 00:09:13,660
the pivot point of the object when I

208
00:09:13,660 --> 00:09:15,610
wanted to resize the tree but if I press

209
00:09:15,610 --> 00:09:19,779
the key that comma key no then it'll

210
00:09:19,779 --> 00:09:21,850
change it to the center of the vertices

211
00:09:21,850 --> 00:09:25,360
that I've added or these faces here and

212
00:09:25,360 --> 00:09:29,680
I press shift D again now I can actually

213
00:09:29,680 --> 00:09:31,209
use these arrows as well as since I

214
00:09:31,209 --> 00:09:33,040
press the comma key to get the center

215
00:09:33,040 --> 00:09:36,910
point of the mesh so now I've added some

216
00:09:36,910 --> 00:09:39,670
then that looks crap to be honest but

217
00:09:39,670 --> 00:09:42,610
we're not done yet so let's fix this we

218
00:09:42,610 --> 00:09:44,800
don't want this like perfect symmetrical

219
00:09:44,800 --> 00:09:48,040
or spherical shape so basically what you

220
00:09:48,040 --> 00:09:50,680
can do now is if you press tab mode

221
00:09:50,680 --> 00:09:53,230
you can actually select if I press L now

222
00:09:53,230 --> 00:09:55,990
it will select all the linked faces or

223
00:09:55,990 --> 00:09:58,660
vertices for this particular group of

224
00:09:58,660 --> 00:10:01,839
vertices and I if I just go and click

225
00:10:01,839 --> 00:10:04,000
the L key now on all these I aim with

226
00:10:04,000 --> 00:10:06,399
the mouse and I click L then I can

227
00:10:06,399 --> 00:10:08,170
select all the faces here I could have

228
00:10:08,170 --> 00:10:10,240
clicked a actually so if I deselect

229
00:10:10,240 --> 00:10:12,010
everything in click again so in this

230
00:10:12,010 --> 00:10:13,990
case I could have used a but sometimes

231
00:10:13,990 --> 00:10:15,640
it's really useful to use the L key to

232
00:10:15,640 --> 00:10:19,899
get the linked vertices and first thing

233
00:10:19,899 --> 00:10:22,480
we can do for example is let's let's

234
00:10:22,480 --> 00:10:23,860
actually rescale this and make these a

235
00:10:23,860 --> 00:10:25,570
little bit bigger and then I can't be in

236
00:10:25,570 --> 00:10:27,910
this with everything selected because if

237
00:10:27,910 --> 00:10:30,160
I do that as you can see that all like

238
00:10:30,160 --> 00:10:33,070
just sent outwards so this operation

239
00:10:33,070 --> 00:10:34,420
actually need to do on these

240
00:10:34,420 --> 00:10:36,459
individually so I click again to

241
00:10:36,459 --> 00:10:41,709
deselect I click L or let's see I mean

242
00:10:41,709 --> 00:10:43,600
select the face first L to select this

243
00:10:43,600 --> 00:10:46,270
face and then now if I scale it scales

244
00:10:46,270 --> 00:10:47,920
it in place here so let's just click

245
00:10:47,920 --> 00:10:52,029
these L to get the links and then just

246
00:10:52,029 --> 00:10:54,220
to make these a little bit bigger L for

247
00:10:54,220 --> 00:10:58,680
the link once I select with the right

248
00:10:58,680 --> 00:11:01,990
with the right mouse button l scale up a

249
00:11:01,990 --> 00:11:09,209
little bit and this one again L scale so

250
00:11:09,209 --> 00:11:12,850
and now we want to get some irregularity

251
00:11:12,850 --> 00:11:15,250
to this these look weight around so what

252
00:11:15,250 --> 00:11:17,050
you can do then for example is if I

253
00:11:17,050 --> 00:11:20,350
click a to select everything or actually

254
00:11:20,350 --> 00:11:21,400
I don't need to do that because this

255
00:11:21,400 --> 00:11:23,500
operates on the whole mesh mode or on

256
00:11:23,500 --> 00:11:25,180
the whole object level so and I go to

257
00:11:25,180 --> 00:11:26,560
the modifier and I want to end a

258
00:11:26,560 --> 00:11:30,970
displace modifier and here I want to

259
00:11:30,970 --> 00:11:36,220
click on new and change this into I'll

260
00:11:36,220 --> 00:11:38,950
click on this one here and I change this

261
00:11:38,950 --> 00:11:43,570
into a cloud texture resume this in a

262
00:11:43,570 --> 00:11:45,700
little bit then I go back to the

263
00:11:45,700 --> 00:11:48,339
modifier and if I change the strength

264
00:11:48,339 --> 00:11:50,740
here now I need to go out of edit mode

265
00:11:50,740 --> 00:11:53,320
actually so I tab now you can see that

266
00:11:53,320 --> 00:11:56,140
it warps this the mesh is a little bit

267
00:11:56,140 --> 00:11:59,310
thing gets out of that it regular so

268
00:11:59,310 --> 00:12:01,450
when I do that

269
00:12:01,450 --> 00:12:03,790
you get starting to get a little bit of

270
00:12:03,790 --> 00:12:07,829
a different view to it I'll do it

271
00:12:07,829 --> 00:12:10,690
you can also change change this one the

272
00:12:10,690 --> 00:12:12,490
level so let's say we wanted it like

273
00:12:12,490 --> 00:12:12,910
that

274
00:12:12,910 --> 00:12:15,490
maybe that's and then I click apply here

275
00:12:15,490 --> 00:12:18,399
now so this could be one tree if you

276
00:12:18,399 --> 00:12:20,560
wanted like this I still think it needs

277
00:12:20,560 --> 00:12:23,140
a little bit of work to it so usually I

278
00:12:23,140 --> 00:12:26,500
just play around in in this edit mode

279
00:12:26,500 --> 00:12:29,760
here so maybe for example I want to do

280
00:12:29,760 --> 00:12:32,680
if I add another modifier here saying

281
00:12:32,680 --> 00:12:37,269
let's subdivide this one into let's see

282
00:12:37,269 --> 00:12:39,640
that work no that's gonna be way too

283
00:12:39,640 --> 00:12:42,010
many meshes so that's not subdivide it

284
00:12:42,010 --> 00:12:49,709
let's instead do this decimates modifier

285
00:12:50,670 --> 00:12:54,579
and then scale it down then I start

286
00:12:54,579 --> 00:12:57,010
reducing actually vertices here to get

287
00:12:57,010 --> 00:12:59,910
even more of a low poly look like that

288
00:12:59,910 --> 00:13:04,149
and when I go into edit mode you see

289
00:13:04,149 --> 00:13:05,769
that effect disappears and it's because

290
00:13:05,769 --> 00:13:07,620
it's showing me the mesh instead this

291
00:13:07,620 --> 00:13:11,110
modifier operates on not on on the mesh

292
00:13:11,110 --> 00:13:12,970
edit mode but on the object mode so I

293
00:13:12,970 --> 00:13:14,350
need to be out of the mesh edit mode

294
00:13:14,350 --> 00:13:17,560
with a table here let's apply this one

295
00:13:17,560 --> 00:13:20,529
and I still think that these groups of

296
00:13:20,529 --> 00:13:22,540
these chunks should be a bit bigger so

297
00:13:22,540 --> 00:13:23,740
let's make them a little bit bigger

298
00:13:23,740 --> 00:13:26,560
again tab into edit mode I'll click on

299
00:13:26,560 --> 00:13:29,949
one face ll to select all the link s to

300
00:13:29,949 --> 00:13:32,529
scale it let's scale all of these up l

301
00:13:32,529 --> 00:13:40,810
scale select L scale just like that face

302
00:13:40,810 --> 00:13:46,420
owl scale and then L to select links and

303
00:13:46,420 --> 00:13:48,850
then scale here we go so now we're

304
00:13:48,850 --> 00:13:50,829
starting to get a tree that I like the

305
00:13:50,829 --> 00:13:53,860
look of then I like to name them

306
00:13:53,860 --> 00:13:56,800
properly I press shift C to get back

307
00:13:56,800 --> 00:14:03,209
into the cursor mode in if it

308
00:14:03,209 --> 00:14:04,860
if it's when you rotated you and it

309
00:14:04,860 --> 00:14:07,529
doesn't pivot around this you can press

310
00:14:07,529 --> 00:14:11,699
the del Delete key I think now I should

311
00:14:11,699 --> 00:14:20,519
have fully rotates nope there we go

312
00:14:20,519 --> 00:14:26,100
I needed up in object mode so I press I

313
00:14:26,100 --> 00:14:27,809
don't want to go into orthographic mode

314
00:14:27,809 --> 00:14:30,509
again here now and then number one to

315
00:14:30,509 --> 00:14:32,519
get the front view so let's say I was

316
00:14:32,519 --> 00:14:35,279
happy with this tree now and then I want

317
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:38,249
to rename my objects I'm up to treat 12

318
00:14:38,249 --> 00:14:41,579
here so I'm gonna make 3 13 so this cube

319
00:14:41,579 --> 00:14:42,929
I'll double click on that one and rename

320
00:14:42,929 --> 00:14:48,389
it tree Oh 13 there because this one as

321
00:14:48,389 --> 00:14:50,399
you can see has not doesn't have the

322
00:14:50,399 --> 00:14:51,050
leaves

323
00:14:51,050 --> 00:14:53,249
let's now let's move that one out

324
00:14:53,249 --> 00:14:55,410
because we want to keep that one for a

325
00:14:55,410 --> 00:14:58,709
bear tree but I'm pleased chef D to

326
00:14:58,709 --> 00:15:01,470
duplicate the whole object escaped

327
00:15:01,470 --> 00:15:04,889
because and then we can move it back to

328
00:15:04,889 --> 00:15:07,649
0 here and now what I want to do is I

329
00:15:07,649 --> 00:15:09,240
want to parent or I want to join so I

330
00:15:09,240 --> 00:15:12,839
select these this object with all the

331
00:15:12,839 --> 00:15:17,189
leaves and then I shift and oh no yeah

332
00:15:17,189 --> 00:15:18,689
sorry I shift and right click on the

333
00:15:18,689 --> 00:15:23,369
tree and I press ctrl J to join these

334
00:15:23,369 --> 00:15:26,369
together so now it's a single mesh and

335
00:15:26,369 --> 00:15:32,189
let's call this one regular so this is

336
00:15:32,189 --> 00:15:36,839
the normal look of this tree and this

337
00:15:36,839 --> 00:15:41,129
tree model is actually finished I think

338
00:15:41,129 --> 00:15:48,209
I'm allergic to blender maybe so let's

339
00:15:48,209 --> 00:15:50,399
go this tree is finished now but let's

340
00:15:50,399 --> 00:15:52,019
say I want to make a different

341
00:15:52,019 --> 00:15:55,850
variations as you can see here I've got

342
00:15:55,850 --> 00:15:58,470
got a bunch of four variations of each

343
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,089
tree and I want to make another one so

344
00:16:00,089 --> 00:16:01,949
I've moved out onto this side I crap

345
00:16:01,949 --> 00:16:07,399
press shift D to duplicate it escape

346
00:16:08,350 --> 00:16:10,780
back and then I'll move it to here and

347
00:16:10,780 --> 00:16:12,490
now I want to operate just on these

348
00:16:12,490 --> 00:16:13,870
leaves I want to keep the stem the same

349
00:16:13,870 --> 00:16:19,180
way so if I go into edit mode now I want

350
00:16:19,180 --> 00:16:24,270
to break this into a separate mesh again

351
00:16:24,270 --> 00:16:26,620
so I can operate on just the leaves and

352
00:16:26,620 --> 00:16:28,930
not this the easiest way to do that one

353
00:16:28,930 --> 00:16:31,810
is to select something on the tree here

354
00:16:31,810 --> 00:16:33,790
and repress l-4 linked and that will

355
00:16:33,790 --> 00:16:36,400
pick all the vertexes and/or vertices

356
00:16:36,400 --> 00:16:39,010
and faces for the tree trunk there press

357
00:16:39,010 --> 00:16:42,610
ctrl I to invert that selection and then

358
00:16:42,610 --> 00:16:46,240
I press P to separate and I separate by

359
00:16:46,240 --> 00:16:48,520
selection here and now this is snapped

360
00:16:48,520 --> 00:16:50,710
back into a separate object as you can

361
00:16:50,710 --> 00:16:56,140
see here so if I select this one last

362
00:16:56,140 --> 00:16:57,670
you can see this is a separate object

363
00:16:57,670 --> 00:16:59,740
now and that's how I want to work on on

364
00:16:59,740 --> 00:17:01,600
this and now let's make a little

365
00:17:01,600 --> 00:17:04,359
variation so I go into edit mode and I

366
00:17:04,359 --> 00:17:06,190
select all the vertices and then maybe I

367
00:17:06,190 --> 00:17:07,650
want to scale them up a little bit and

368
00:17:07,650 --> 00:17:09,819
here I like to start playing as well

369
00:17:09,819 --> 00:17:11,470
with this proportional editing so I

370
00:17:11,470 --> 00:17:14,500
enabled this proportional editing and

371
00:17:14,500 --> 00:17:16,930
then maybe I want to select some random

372
00:17:16,930 --> 00:17:19,950
vertices at the top here of the mesh

373
00:17:19,950 --> 00:17:22,480
press one to get into the front view

374
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:22,750
again

375
00:17:22,750 --> 00:17:25,599
let's select shift select this vertex

376
00:17:25,599 --> 00:17:27,670
this one and then if I move this up now

377
00:17:27,670 --> 00:17:29,860
you can see not only does it move the

378
00:17:29,860 --> 00:17:31,630
vertices that are selected but it moves

379
00:17:31,630 --> 00:17:33,520
the ones that are in the vicinity as

380
00:17:33,520 --> 00:17:37,630
well this is insanity so you say in the

381
00:17:37,630 --> 00:17:41,230
neighborhood and if I press controls and

382
00:17:41,230 --> 00:17:43,300
I do that again I can also press G to

383
00:17:43,300 --> 00:17:47,560
grab this and then I press Z or Z to

384
00:17:47,560 --> 00:17:51,370
force it to move it on the the z-axis up

385
00:17:51,370 --> 00:17:53,350
and down and then if I use the scroll

386
00:17:53,350 --> 00:17:55,300
wheel now I can change how much this

387
00:17:55,300 --> 00:17:57,070
proportional editing should be affecting

388
00:17:57,070 --> 00:18:00,730
this so I can pull this up so if I

389
00:18:00,730 --> 00:18:02,320
change this one maybe I want to create

390
00:18:02,320 --> 00:18:04,090
the tree that looks a bit like this and

391
00:18:04,090 --> 00:18:07,180
I can also use scaling and that's also

392
00:18:07,180 --> 00:18:12,010
proportional so now we suddenly got a

393
00:18:12,010 --> 00:18:14,140
trade with a different look to it

394
00:18:14,140 --> 00:18:16,960
similar but still enough different to

395
00:18:16,960 --> 00:18:19,600
maybe save that one and to keep this

396
00:18:19,600 --> 00:18:21,500
tree I want to have it as one mesh

397
00:18:21,500 --> 00:18:24,409
or one object at least so I click on

398
00:18:24,409 --> 00:18:26,480
this one and I shift and right click on

399
00:18:26,480 --> 00:18:29,140
the tree trunk I press ctrl J to join it

400
00:18:29,140 --> 00:18:32,900
I'm gonna rename this one to Lush maybe

401
00:18:32,900 --> 00:18:34,880
because it's nice and lush it's got some

402
00:18:34,880 --> 00:18:39,440
more foilage to it let's one make one

403
00:18:39,440 --> 00:18:41,360
last variation of this tree as well just

404
00:18:41,360 --> 00:18:45,530
to cement this whole thing in I press I

405
00:18:45,530 --> 00:18:46,460
select this one

406
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:50,240
press shift D to duplicate it escape to

407
00:18:50,240 --> 00:18:52,520
snap it back I move it into view here

408
00:18:52,520 --> 00:18:53,929
where I would like to work on it it's

409
00:18:53,929 --> 00:18:55,070
not a must that you do it

410
00:18:55,070 --> 00:18:57,289
that's origin here but I like to do it

411
00:18:57,289 --> 00:19:01,090
that way let's go into tab mode again

412
00:19:01,090 --> 00:19:04,820
edits this object and remember here we

413
00:19:04,820 --> 00:19:07,190
want to select something on the tree

414
00:19:07,190 --> 00:19:09,110
trunk press L to get all the link

415
00:19:09,110 --> 00:19:12,169
vertices ctrl I to invert the selection

416
00:19:12,169 --> 00:19:15,770
and then press P to the touch

417
00:19:15,770 --> 00:19:19,730
selection separator now I can work on

418
00:19:19,730 --> 00:19:22,520
this object alone and here maybe we want

419
00:19:22,520 --> 00:19:25,760
to I like to twist these around as well

420
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,500
so if I select the top vertices here

421
00:19:27,500 --> 00:19:28,880
again like I did last time

422
00:19:28,880 --> 00:19:31,760
and one nice effect for these low poly

423
00:19:31,760 --> 00:19:33,380
trees I found was if you select this one

424
00:19:33,380 --> 00:19:35,470
you keep this proportional editing

425
00:19:35,470 --> 00:19:38,630
enabled and you press R to rotate and

426
00:19:38,630 --> 00:19:42,169
then Zed to make sure that it rotates

427
00:19:42,169 --> 00:19:45,650
around the center is that axis let's

428
00:19:45,650 --> 00:19:47,570
scale this one up with me so if you just

429
00:19:47,570 --> 00:19:49,429
add a little slight twist to it that can

430
00:19:49,429 --> 00:19:51,230
make the trees look a bit interesting as

431
00:19:51,230 --> 00:19:54,140
well like that for example I've got

432
00:19:54,140 --> 00:19:58,190
quite a nice aesthetics - I think and

433
00:19:58,190 --> 00:20:00,409
then let's add a little bit more let's

434
00:20:00,409 --> 00:20:01,580
try a little bit more on this particular

435
00:20:01,580 --> 00:20:04,370
mesh let's see how this goes so I go tab

436
00:20:04,370 --> 00:20:06,110
out of into object mode let's add this

437
00:20:06,110 --> 00:20:10,850
modifier now and do a subdivision to

438
00:20:10,850 --> 00:20:16,100
levels and the let's apply this modifier

439
00:20:16,100 --> 00:20:17,090
and this is going to be too many

440
00:20:17,090 --> 00:20:19,100
polygons now for this low poly look this

441
00:20:19,100 --> 00:20:22,340
is starting to get too detailed but

442
00:20:22,340 --> 00:20:24,409
before we decimate this one that still

443
00:20:24,409 --> 00:20:26,990
add a modifier and displace this one a

444
00:20:26,990 --> 00:20:30,799
little bit let's pick that texture that

445
00:20:30,799 --> 00:20:32,179
we did before which was the cloud

446
00:20:32,179 --> 00:20:33,299
texture

447
00:20:33,299 --> 00:20:35,129
and let's play around with a strength a

448
00:20:35,129 --> 00:20:40,919
little bit maybe like that apply this

449
00:20:40,919 --> 00:20:43,139
modifier and then finally let's do a big

450
00:20:43,139 --> 00:20:44,960
decimate here as well this way too many

451
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:49,669
their faces on this one so let's do

452
00:20:49,669 --> 00:21:00,299
decimates bring it down to and then

453
00:21:00,299 --> 00:21:01,710
apply this one and as you can see now

454
00:21:01,710 --> 00:21:03,419
it's a lot further it's a lot fewer

455
00:21:03,419 --> 00:21:06,179
here's what another trick yard to get a

456
00:21:06,179 --> 00:21:08,820
little bit different as you can if you

457
00:21:08,820 --> 00:21:11,279
remember I had a palette here in the UV

458
00:21:11,279 --> 00:21:16,139
mapping with some different colors so if

459
00:21:16,139 --> 00:21:20,489
I do seven to get the top view here and

460
00:21:20,489 --> 00:21:21,989
then make sure I don't have this

461
00:21:21,989 --> 00:21:23,759
transparency thing selected so that's

462
00:21:23,759 --> 00:21:26,700
disabled I press the B key for box

463
00:21:26,700 --> 00:21:29,700
select and now it's selected all the

464
00:21:29,700 --> 00:21:34,200
faces that have that can be viewed from

465
00:21:34,200 --> 00:21:35,940
on top and I want to reduce the

466
00:21:35,940 --> 00:21:37,350
selection a little bit by shrinking it

467
00:21:37,350 --> 00:21:42,149
so press ctrl - on the numpad and that

468
00:21:42,149 --> 00:21:43,470
shrinks down my selection a little bit

469
00:21:43,470 --> 00:21:46,080
and then I press G here when I'm over

470
00:21:46,080 --> 00:21:49,730
the UV map and I'll move this to there

471
00:21:49,730 --> 00:21:52,859
and now I've got some parts some

472
00:21:52,859 --> 00:21:55,169
polygons that are brighter up here with

473
00:21:55,169 --> 00:21:57,749
a different shade and also if I press

474
00:21:57,749 --> 00:22:00,210
ctrl 7 I'll in the same way I'll get the

475
00:22:00,210 --> 00:22:05,279
base of the tree so b4 box selected and

476
00:22:05,279 --> 00:22:07,830
then ctrl - to shrink it down a little

477
00:22:07,830 --> 00:22:08,249
bit

478
00:22:08,249 --> 00:22:11,220
actually let's go into the face then

479
00:22:11,220 --> 00:22:12,869
maybe I'll keep the shift key and I'll

480
00:22:12,869 --> 00:22:14,249
press a few of these as well I'll just

481
00:22:14,249 --> 00:22:18,450
select some random meshes down here or

482
00:22:18,450 --> 00:22:23,450
faces sorry maybe these pose as well

483
00:22:25,929 --> 00:22:29,990
like that and then I go over here on the

484
00:22:29,990 --> 00:22:32,059
left side press G and I move this down

485
00:22:32,059 --> 00:22:34,429
to the darker shade so now we've got a

486
00:22:34,429 --> 00:22:36,169
little bit of color variation in this to

487
00:22:36,169 --> 00:22:41,270
usable so there we go finally is to join

488
00:22:41,270 --> 00:22:43,700
this one so I'll go back into the

489
00:22:43,700 --> 00:22:47,750
default view here press one to get the

490
00:22:47,750 --> 00:22:51,410
front view select this one shift selects

491
00:22:51,410 --> 00:22:55,549
tree trunk control J and then let's call

492
00:22:55,549 --> 00:23:05,809
this one twisty here we go so that's the

493
00:23:05,809 --> 00:23:06,470
low-poly

494
00:23:06,470 --> 00:23:08,750
editing of this tree maybe that gave you

495
00:23:08,750 --> 00:23:10,280
some hints and tips and tricks on how to

496
00:23:10,280 --> 00:23:13,100
do low poly edit modeling in blender and

497
00:23:13,100 --> 00:23:15,740
in the next video I'll import this tree

498
00:23:15,740 --> 00:23:17,990
into unity and I'll show you an

499
00:23:17,990 --> 00:23:19,760
amplified shader that I made using the

500
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:23,360
amplify acid and it'll add some

501
00:23:23,360 --> 00:23:25,250
character to the tree by making its way

502
00:23:25,250 --> 00:23:26,720
a little bit in the wind using the

503
00:23:26,720 --> 00:23:29,840
vertex shader and it'll also I'll make a

504
00:23:29,840 --> 00:23:31,490
little weather effect to them as well

505
00:23:31,490 --> 00:23:33,410
that you can look at so have a look at

506
00:23:33,410 --> 00:23:36,679
that video you can view it so I'll put a

507
00:23:36,679 --> 00:23:38,200
link here somewhere just click on that

508
00:23:38,200 --> 00:23:40,549
enjoy I hope you have fun modeling in

509
00:23:40,549 --> 00:23:44,500
blender take care see ya
