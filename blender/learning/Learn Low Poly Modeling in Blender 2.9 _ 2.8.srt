00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,920
welcome my name is esther from passion

2
00:00:01,920 --> 00:00:03,600
also known as infensia you might have

3
00:00:03,600 --> 00:00:05,040
seen my 10 minutes build before for

4
00:00:05,040 --> 00:00:06,560
example where i made 10 cars in 10

5
00:00:06,560 --> 00:00:07,279
minutes or

6
00:00:07,279 --> 00:00:09,519
maybe a rigged dragon or a rigged pirate

7
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,759
or a star destroyer i've had quite a few

8
00:00:11,759 --> 00:00:13,120
comments from my 10 minute modeling

9
00:00:13,120 --> 00:00:14,719
challenge where people say well this is

10
00:00:14,719 --> 00:00:16,320
too fast for me to learn from this is

11
00:00:16,320 --> 00:00:17,359
not a good tutorial

12
00:00:17,359 --> 00:00:19,359
and i wanted to make this video to

13
00:00:19,359 --> 00:00:21,199
really cover everything that i know at a

14
00:00:21,199 --> 00:00:22,320
slow enough pace

15
00:00:22,320 --> 00:00:24,000
so for those of you who thinks that 10

16
00:00:24,000 --> 00:00:25,439
minute modeling is too fast and you

17
00:00:25,439 --> 00:00:25,840
don't

18
00:00:25,840 --> 00:00:27,199
have a clue what i'm going on about

19
00:00:27,199 --> 00:00:28,720
hopefully this video will give you a lot

20
00:00:28,720 --> 00:00:30,560
of insight and details

21
00:00:30,560 --> 00:00:32,880
in a step-by-step fashion so we could

22
00:00:32,880 --> 00:00:34,559
help you out in your modeling skills

23
00:00:34,559 --> 00:00:36,079
you could even start using this tutorial

24
00:00:36,079 --> 00:00:37,440
if you're brand new to blender because

25
00:00:37,440 --> 00:00:38,559
i'm going to go through everything in

26
00:00:38,559 --> 00:00:39,280
detail

27
00:00:39,280 --> 00:00:41,120
if you're experienced in blender maybe

28
00:00:41,120 --> 00:00:43,040
this first few minutes won't be so

29
00:00:43,040 --> 00:00:44,800
necessary for you to watch but you

30
00:00:44,800 --> 00:00:46,399
should be able to pick up a few tips

31
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:47,200
because i've found

32
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,719
a lot even though i've done this for

33
00:00:48,719 --> 00:00:50,800
quite a few years i find out stuff all

34
00:00:50,800 --> 00:00:52,480
the time about new nifty ways to do

35
00:00:52,480 --> 00:00:54,000
things so maybe you'll find something

36
00:00:54,000 --> 00:00:58,000
out of this video too

37
00:00:58,000 --> 00:00:59,920
you navigate just press the middle mouse

38
00:00:59,920 --> 00:01:01,520
button to rotate

39
00:01:01,520 --> 00:01:03,359
you hold the shift key and the middle

40
00:01:03,359 --> 00:01:05,920
mouse button to pan around in a scene

41
00:01:05,920 --> 00:01:08,000
and you use the scroll wheel to zoom in

42
00:01:08,000 --> 00:01:10,000
and out there's also a few shortcuts

43
00:01:10,000 --> 00:01:11,520
that you should know in the viewport and

44
00:01:11,520 --> 00:01:13,360
on the keypad you can press 1

45
00:01:13,360 --> 00:01:15,840
to see the front view press 3 to get a

46
00:01:15,840 --> 00:01:16,479
side view

47
00:01:16,479 --> 00:01:18,799
and 7 to get a top view you can also

48
00:01:18,799 --> 00:01:19,600
toggle between

49
00:01:19,600 --> 00:01:22,320
orthographic and perspective mode using

50
00:01:22,320 --> 00:01:24,720
5 on the keypad basically that removes

51
00:01:24,720 --> 00:01:26,640
the perspective and that's useful

52
00:01:26,640 --> 00:01:28,080
sometimes to do as well up here you've

53
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,520
got something called the outliner and

54
00:01:29,520 --> 00:01:30,880
this will show you which object you've

55
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:31,920
got in your scene

56
00:01:31,920 --> 00:01:34,000
and down here is a properties area and

57
00:01:34,000 --> 00:01:35,600
we'll only be using this

58
00:01:35,600 --> 00:01:37,360
spanner looking thing here which is

59
00:01:37,360 --> 00:01:39,280
modifier properties the rest we can

60
00:01:39,280 --> 00:01:40,000
ignore for now

61
00:01:40,000 --> 00:01:42,479
i also like to use the n key to bring

62
00:01:42,479 --> 00:01:43,759
this numbers panel up

63
00:01:43,759 --> 00:01:45,360
in where we can type in details

64
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,360
sometimes in blender we use the left

65
00:01:47,360 --> 00:01:48,880
click to select nowadays it used to be

66
00:01:48,880 --> 00:01:50,320
right click but nowadays it's left

67
00:01:50,320 --> 00:01:50,799
clicking

68
00:01:50,799 --> 00:01:52,479
thank god for that if you use the right

69
00:01:52,479 --> 00:01:54,079
mouse button you get a context menu

70
00:01:54,079 --> 00:01:55,680
up i don't really use that one so much

71
00:01:55,680 --> 00:01:56,960
maybe you'll find use of it but there

72
00:01:56,960 --> 00:01:58,240
are a few things i do if you want to

73
00:01:58,240 --> 00:01:59,759
delete things you press the delete key

74
00:01:59,759 --> 00:02:01,280
and we can get rid of this light here

75
00:02:01,280 --> 00:02:02,399
for example and this

76
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:03,759
camera we don't need those when we do

77
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,200
modeling if you accidentally delete

78
00:02:05,200 --> 00:02:05,759
something

79
00:02:05,759 --> 00:02:07,600
then you can press ctrl z like in most

80
00:02:07,600 --> 00:02:10,640
programs to bring it back

81
00:02:12,959 --> 00:02:14,480
one of the most common questions that i

82
00:02:14,480 --> 00:02:16,879
get asked is how i colorize my low poly

83
00:02:16,879 --> 00:02:18,560
objects colorizing your objects is

84
00:02:18,560 --> 00:02:20,160
essential to get those low poly

85
00:02:20,160 --> 00:02:22,000
objects look just right i go to the

86
00:02:22,000 --> 00:02:24,000
shading tab and if you go to the

87
00:02:24,000 --> 00:02:24,640
description

88
00:02:24,640 --> 00:02:26,239
you can download this file as well i've

89
00:02:26,239 --> 00:02:27,760
created a palette for you and you can

90
00:02:27,760 --> 00:02:30,239
just drag this png file right into this

91
00:02:30,239 --> 00:02:32,800
section of your shading view material

92
00:02:32,800 --> 00:02:34,800
editor window here you can also download

93
00:02:34,800 --> 00:02:35,120
the

94
00:02:35,120 --> 00:02:36,879
palettes from lowspec.com for example

95
00:02:36,879 --> 00:02:38,000
they've got loads of palettes or you

96
00:02:38,000 --> 00:02:39,599
could create your own ones in

97
00:02:39,599 --> 00:02:41,440
any drawing program like photoshop i use

98
00:02:41,440 --> 00:02:42,959
for example but you can use free ones as

99
00:02:42,959 --> 00:02:43,280
well

100
00:02:43,280 --> 00:02:45,360
and be aware that my textures i do them

101
00:02:45,360 --> 00:02:47,519
in extremely low resolution this one is

102
00:02:47,519 --> 00:02:49,280
only eight by eight pixels because it

103
00:02:49,280 --> 00:02:50,000
saves a lot of

104
00:02:50,000 --> 00:02:52,080
texture space when you do import it into

105
00:02:52,080 --> 00:02:53,040
a game engine

106
00:02:53,040 --> 00:02:54,720
but we need to collect this color node

107
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,480
here to the base color and you can see

108
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:58,080
that it's really blurry here now and

109
00:02:58,080 --> 00:03:00,000
it's because it's so low resolution so

110
00:03:00,000 --> 00:03:02,080
we also need to change from linear here

111
00:03:02,080 --> 00:03:04,159
to closest and that'll bring make it

112
00:03:04,159 --> 00:03:06,000
crisp and nice i actually use the

113
00:03:06,000 --> 00:03:08,000
uv editing tab to do most of my modeling

114
00:03:08,000 --> 00:03:09,680
because if i zoom in here with the mouse

115
00:03:09,680 --> 00:03:11,120
wheel on the left you can see i've got

116
00:03:11,120 --> 00:03:13,200
quick access now to these colors that

117
00:03:13,200 --> 00:03:15,200
are in that texture if i resize this as

118
00:03:15,200 --> 00:03:15,920
well

119
00:03:15,920 --> 00:03:17,599
now the cube here as you can see is

120
00:03:17,599 --> 00:03:19,360
unfolded onto this texture

121
00:03:19,360 --> 00:03:21,760
and it's basically representing the 3d

122
00:03:21,760 --> 00:03:24,480
cube in 2d texture space

123
00:03:24,480 --> 00:03:26,000
if i use this little drop down here we

124
00:03:26,000 --> 00:03:27,760
can switch the texture and that shows

125
00:03:27,760 --> 00:03:29,200
you exactly how these

126
00:03:29,200 --> 00:03:31,599
uvs are laid out so this front side for

127
00:03:31,599 --> 00:03:32,480
example is

128
00:03:32,480 --> 00:03:34,319
represented right here we've got quick

129
00:03:34,319 --> 00:03:36,400
access now to colorize this object

130
00:03:36,400 --> 00:03:38,879
if i select all of these faces with a

131
00:03:38,879 --> 00:03:39,599
key

132
00:03:39,599 --> 00:03:41,280
and then on the left side here now i

133
00:03:41,280 --> 00:03:43,440
press a and then i scale it down

134
00:03:43,440 --> 00:03:46,000
to zero and then i can press g on the

135
00:03:46,000 --> 00:03:47,440
left side here to move it

136
00:03:47,440 --> 00:03:50,959
g for grab or move g as in move and if i

137
00:03:50,959 --> 00:03:52,560
place it over green here now

138
00:03:52,560 --> 00:03:54,640
the cube becomes green and if i wanted

139
00:03:54,640 --> 00:03:56,400
to change this face color here

140
00:03:56,400 --> 00:03:58,879
i select the face and i press g on the

141
00:03:58,879 --> 00:04:00,400
left side here and i can change that

142
00:04:00,400 --> 00:04:00,959
face

143
00:04:00,959 --> 00:04:04,080
to orange and this is a really fast way

144
00:04:04,080 --> 00:04:05,920
to colorize your low poly objects and

145
00:04:05,920 --> 00:04:07,840
make them look really crisp and clean

146
00:04:07,840 --> 00:04:09,280
don't worry i'll cover the hotkeys as

147
00:04:09,280 --> 00:04:11,120
well about moving and scaling and things

148
00:04:11,120 --> 00:04:12,640
like that in detail this was just to

149
00:04:12,640 --> 00:04:14,239
demonstrate the coloring process

150
00:04:14,239 --> 00:04:15,280
there are a few things that you need to

151
00:04:15,280 --> 00:04:16,798
be aware of when you do this when i

152
00:04:16,798 --> 00:04:18,320
scale down this uv here down to

153
00:04:18,320 --> 00:04:20,079
basically zero as you can see it's just

154
00:04:20,079 --> 00:04:21,440
a little dot when you import these

155
00:04:21,440 --> 00:04:22,880
objects into a game engine like

156
00:04:22,880 --> 00:04:25,440
unity or unreal they might require a uv

157
00:04:25,440 --> 00:04:26,000
layout

158
00:04:26,000 --> 00:04:28,240
to render for example shadows correctly

159
00:04:28,240 --> 00:04:29,360
in unity you can

160
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:32,320
enable unity to generate a second set of

161
00:04:32,320 --> 00:04:34,479
uvs or you can create a second set of

162
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,639
uvs in blender here we don't need to do

163
00:04:36,639 --> 00:04:37,840
that at this point because

164
00:04:37,840 --> 00:04:39,040
i'm just going to show you the coloring

165
00:04:39,040 --> 00:04:40,960
process but be aware that there might be

166
00:04:40,960 --> 00:04:42,320
some tweaks that you need to do

167
00:04:42,320 --> 00:04:43,680
when you're going to start using these

168
00:04:43,680 --> 00:04:46,800
assets in a game engine

169
00:04:48,720 --> 00:04:50,479
the second most common question i get in

170
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:51,759
all my comments is

171
00:04:51,759 --> 00:04:53,360
i change my viewport settings a little

172
00:04:53,360 --> 00:04:54,880
bit and people are asking how i get

173
00:04:54,880 --> 00:04:56,800
about to do that so if you use this drop

174
00:04:56,800 --> 00:04:57,520
down here

175
00:04:57,520 --> 00:05:00,479
i often model with shadows enabled and

176
00:05:00,479 --> 00:05:02,800
especially this cavity feature here

177
00:05:02,800 --> 00:05:05,440
and if i change type here to both world

178
00:05:05,440 --> 00:05:06,080
and screen

179
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:08,400
or as a world in screen i select both

180
00:05:08,400 --> 00:05:09,919
here and i ramp these

181
00:05:09,919 --> 00:05:12,639
up then you get glowing edges onto your

182
00:05:12,639 --> 00:05:13,199
objects

183
00:05:13,199 --> 00:05:14,720
and when you make low poly art for

184
00:05:14,720 --> 00:05:16,639
example like a car or a tree or

185
00:05:16,639 --> 00:05:17,840
something whatever a

186
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:20,320
character even then having this cavity

187
00:05:20,320 --> 00:05:21,680
enabled can make the

188
00:05:21,680 --> 00:05:23,759
low poly objects really stand out nicely

189
00:05:23,759 --> 00:05:25,919
so i usually do this when i model

190
00:05:25,919 --> 00:05:27,840
you can also use the workbench render to

191
00:05:27,840 --> 00:05:29,840
render objects using the cavity settings

192
00:05:29,840 --> 00:05:31,680
if you want there's one final setting

193
00:05:31,680 --> 00:05:33,280
that i like to recommend and if you use

194
00:05:33,280 --> 00:05:35,039
this drop down again you should enable

195
00:05:35,039 --> 00:05:36,000
this backface

196
00:05:36,000 --> 00:05:38,080
culling feature and that will tell you

197
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,000
if you have faces that are facing the

198
00:05:40,000 --> 00:05:40,880
wrong direction

199
00:05:40,880 --> 00:05:43,039
sometimes you can have a face that's

200
00:05:43,039 --> 00:05:45,120
facing inwards like this one for example

201
00:05:45,120 --> 00:05:46,639
if i go into the cube now you can see

202
00:05:46,639 --> 00:05:48,639
that this face here is facing inwards

203
00:05:48,639 --> 00:05:50,160
and most game engines don't

204
00:05:50,160 --> 00:05:52,240
render the back side of a face you can

205
00:05:52,240 --> 00:05:53,840
enable that but most of the time they

206
00:05:53,840 --> 00:05:54,479
don't render

207
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:56,400
and in blender if you don't have back

208
00:05:56,400 --> 00:05:58,000
face culling then you won't really be

209
00:05:58,000 --> 00:05:59,680
aware that you have some holes like this

210
00:05:59,680 --> 00:06:01,199
in your mesh so i recommend that you

211
00:06:01,199 --> 00:06:02,639
enable back face calling

212
00:06:02,639 --> 00:06:04,240
that way you can see when something is

213
00:06:04,240 --> 00:06:06,000
broken and you can fix it there's

214
00:06:06,000 --> 00:06:07,199
something called for example

215
00:06:07,199 --> 00:06:10,240
if you press f3 and type in flip normals

216
00:06:10,240 --> 00:06:11,520
then you can flip that back but there

217
00:06:11,520 --> 00:06:12,800
are other ways as well i'll tell you

218
00:06:12,800 --> 00:06:15,199
about that

219
00:06:16,160 --> 00:06:17,919
there's something called object mode in

220
00:06:17,919 --> 00:06:19,199
edit mode in blender

221
00:06:19,199 --> 00:06:21,120
and by default when you come in it's in

222
00:06:21,120 --> 00:06:22,639
object mode and

223
00:06:22,639 --> 00:06:24,400
basically you can click click on an

224
00:06:24,400 --> 00:06:26,000
object and it'll select it here in the

225
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:27,919
outliner but to edit an object we need

226
00:06:27,919 --> 00:06:28,560
to press

227
00:06:28,560 --> 00:06:30,479
tab on it because that will give us

228
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:34,639
access to the geometry

229
00:06:34,639 --> 00:06:36,639
and up here you can switch between

230
00:06:36,639 --> 00:06:37,680
vertex

231
00:06:37,680 --> 00:06:40,400
edge and face select you should learn

232
00:06:40,400 --> 00:06:42,080
these hotkeys it's one

233
00:06:42,080 --> 00:06:44,560
two and three to select between those

234
00:06:44,560 --> 00:06:46,080
you could also hold the shift key and

235
00:06:46,080 --> 00:06:47,759
select multiple

236
00:06:47,759 --> 00:06:49,520
i often don't do that because i think

237
00:06:49,520 --> 00:06:51,280
it's a little bit confusing but just be

238
00:06:51,280 --> 00:06:52,560
aware that you can do that if you want

239
00:06:52,560 --> 00:06:53,360
and you can press

240
00:06:53,360 --> 00:06:55,919
a on your keyboard to select everything

241
00:06:55,919 --> 00:06:57,199
and double click a

242
00:06:57,199 --> 00:06:59,120
to deselect everything you can also

243
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:01,440
press alt a to deselect everything

244
00:07:01,440 --> 00:07:03,680
and you can hold the shift key to select

245
00:07:03,680 --> 00:07:04,479
multiple

246
00:07:04,479 --> 00:07:06,319
and if it works as a toggle so if you

247
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,479
click again on them with shift pressed

248
00:07:08,479 --> 00:07:10,240
it toggles between the selection okay

249
00:07:10,240 --> 00:07:11,599
finally we're going to start editing

250
00:07:11,599 --> 00:07:12,639
this mesh a little bit

251
00:07:12,639 --> 00:07:15,280
so if we're in edit mode here i press 3

252
00:07:15,280 --> 00:07:16,160
to go into

253
00:07:16,160 --> 00:07:18,880
face select mode and i click on a face

254
00:07:18,880 --> 00:07:19,680
and i can press

255
00:07:19,680 --> 00:07:22,479
g now to move it in 3d space it's quite

256
00:07:22,479 --> 00:07:24,080
difficult to play something if you just

257
00:07:24,080 --> 00:07:26,080
press g and move it so you can press

258
00:07:26,080 --> 00:07:29,840
shift space and g to enable this little

259
00:07:29,840 --> 00:07:30,880
gizmo here

260
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:33,120
and this way you can basically just drag

261
00:07:33,120 --> 00:07:34,080
it like this instead

262
00:07:34,080 --> 00:07:36,080
to place it and then if you drag on one

263
00:07:36,080 --> 00:07:38,240
of these axis it'll really make it easy

264
00:07:38,240 --> 00:07:40,000
to move something up or down or

265
00:07:40,000 --> 00:07:43,360
left or right back and forth pressing

266
00:07:43,360 --> 00:07:45,199
shift space and g all the time is a bit

267
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,199
tedious so you can also use this drop

268
00:07:47,199 --> 00:07:49,039
down up here and enable the

269
00:07:49,039 --> 00:07:52,000
object gizmo move by default so now when

270
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:52,879
we select something

271
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:54,319
you'll always have the option to be able

272
00:07:54,319 --> 00:07:56,400
to drag it out like this drag it up

273
00:07:56,400 --> 00:07:58,879
and drag it out one more thing about

274
00:07:58,879 --> 00:07:59,520
movement

275
00:07:59,520 --> 00:08:01,199
is if we press one on the keyboard to

276
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,960
get into vertex select here and i pick

277
00:08:02,960 --> 00:08:04,400
this vertex here if i press

278
00:08:04,400 --> 00:08:06,879
g it'll move it anywhere but if i press

279
00:08:06,879 --> 00:08:08,639
g again

280
00:08:08,639 --> 00:08:10,720
it'll actually slide it it's a sliding

281
00:08:10,720 --> 00:08:12,080
method that's really handy

282
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:13,440
to do if you want to just slide this

283
00:08:13,440 --> 00:08:15,759
vertex along here or this one

284
00:08:15,759 --> 00:08:17,840
you want to slide it you press g again

285
00:08:17,840 --> 00:08:19,599
and that makes it easy to slide it along

286
00:08:19,599 --> 00:08:20,160
one edge

287
00:08:20,160 --> 00:08:22,879
the next one is scaling so if i select

288
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,479
three on the keyboard and i press this

289
00:08:24,479 --> 00:08:28,160
face here i can press s to scale it

290
00:08:28,160 --> 00:08:30,319
and you can press this one scale it up

291
00:08:30,319 --> 00:08:31,759
and down and when you scale it

292
00:08:31,759 --> 00:08:33,679
if it really moves like this quick it's

293
00:08:33,679 --> 00:08:34,958
because you press scale when you're

294
00:08:34,958 --> 00:08:36,320
right near the center of it so i

295
00:08:36,320 --> 00:08:37,760
recommend that you move your mouse out a

296
00:08:37,760 --> 00:08:38,320
little bit

297
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:39,679
press scale because then you'll have

298
00:08:39,679 --> 00:08:41,440
more control when you scale it up and

299
00:08:41,440 --> 00:08:42,240
down

300
00:08:42,240 --> 00:08:44,080
also when you scale something if i

301
00:08:44,080 --> 00:08:46,000
select these two faces i hold the shift

302
00:08:46,000 --> 00:08:47,600
key and select both of these and i press

303
00:08:47,600 --> 00:08:49,200
scale you can see that it scales pretty

304
00:08:49,200 --> 00:08:50,959
much the whole cube maybe that's not

305
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:52,160
always what you want

306
00:08:52,160 --> 00:08:53,920
you can then press period on your

307
00:08:53,920 --> 00:08:56,080
keyboard and by default it's using

308
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,080
medium point which is in the center here

309
00:08:58,080 --> 00:08:59,920
but we'll switch this one to individual

310
00:08:59,920 --> 00:09:00,959
origins

311
00:09:00,959 --> 00:09:03,360
and now when you scale it it just scales

312
00:09:03,360 --> 00:09:04,080
it along

313
00:09:04,080 --> 00:09:06,720
its own individual phase origin here so

314
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,160
maybe that's what you're after sometimes

315
00:09:08,160 --> 00:09:09,839
if it doesn't work the way you want

316
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:11,519
but let's go back to medium point which

317
00:09:11,519 --> 00:09:12,959
is also common to use

318
00:09:12,959 --> 00:09:16,080
the next hotkey is e to extrude and if i

319
00:09:16,080 --> 00:09:17,839
select this face and i press e to

320
00:09:17,839 --> 00:09:18,480
extrude

321
00:09:18,480 --> 00:09:20,800
basically it just takes that whole face

322
00:09:20,800 --> 00:09:22,240
and it extrudes it up

323
00:09:22,240 --> 00:09:24,320
this is really useful when it comes to

324
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:25,440
low poly modelling

325
00:09:25,440 --> 00:09:27,519
you can click on any face and press e to

326
00:09:27,519 --> 00:09:29,519
extrude it e to extrude it again

327
00:09:29,519 --> 00:09:33,440
e to extrude e to extrude e to extrude

328
00:09:33,440 --> 00:09:35,440
you can go crazy with this e to extrude

329
00:09:35,440 --> 00:09:36,959
e to extrude

330
00:09:36,959 --> 00:09:38,399
and when you combine this with s to

331
00:09:38,399 --> 00:09:40,640
scale you can quickly start shaping out

332
00:09:40,640 --> 00:09:41,200
objects

333
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:44,000
so you e to extrude s to scale e to

334
00:09:44,000 --> 00:09:45,680
extrude e to extrude

335
00:09:45,680 --> 00:09:48,320
s to scale and the more you become

336
00:09:48,320 --> 00:09:49,680
comfortable with this method

337
00:09:49,680 --> 00:09:51,920
of just scaling and extruding you'll be

338
00:09:51,920 --> 00:09:53,519
able to create something let's go all

339
00:09:53,519 --> 00:09:55,360
the way back down here

340
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,120
to a small object let's colorize the

341
00:09:57,120 --> 00:09:59,519
whole object i'll press a here

342
00:09:59,519 --> 00:10:02,560
s to scale it to 0 here on the left

343
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:04,480
the mouse has to be over the uv here to

344
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:05,600
scale this uv

345
00:10:05,600 --> 00:10:08,399
2d space here to zero i press g to move

346
00:10:08,399 --> 00:10:09,920
it let's move it back to a gray color

347
00:10:09,920 --> 00:10:10,320
here

348
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:13,200
so recolor the whole object now to gray

349
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,720
and let's say i just wanted to create

350
00:10:14,720 --> 00:10:16,000
something like

351
00:10:16,000 --> 00:10:18,320
a skyscraper or something then basically

352
00:10:18,320 --> 00:10:19,200
if i just

353
00:10:19,200 --> 00:10:20,640
what we've learned so far let's move

354
00:10:20,640 --> 00:10:22,560
these out a little bit

355
00:10:22,560 --> 00:10:24,800
and then here let's select this one drag

356
00:10:24,800 --> 00:10:25,920
it up a little bit

357
00:10:25,920 --> 00:10:28,959
and now press e to extrude s to scale it

358
00:10:28,959 --> 00:10:29,519
down

359
00:10:29,519 --> 00:10:31,920
e to extrude again e to extrude s to

360
00:10:31,920 --> 00:10:33,680
scale e to extrude

361
00:10:33,680 --> 00:10:36,000
e to extrude s to scale and then we

362
00:10:36,000 --> 00:10:37,440
could just narrow it off here

363
00:10:37,440 --> 00:10:40,240
e to extrude s to scale e to extrude s

364
00:10:40,240 --> 00:10:41,760
to scale e to extrude

365
00:10:41,760 --> 00:10:43,440
let's make a little ball here e to

366
00:10:43,440 --> 00:10:45,680
extrude s to scale e to extrude

367
00:10:45,680 --> 00:10:47,200
that's the scale you can also type in

368
00:10:47,200 --> 00:10:49,200
values if you wanted to scale this

369
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:50,240
infinitely down

370
00:10:50,240 --> 00:10:52,800
you can type zero now and that basically

371
00:10:52,800 --> 00:10:54,480
scales this phase now

372
00:10:54,480 --> 00:10:57,519
that we learned before down to zero and

373
00:10:57,519 --> 00:10:59,200
now we've created something that could

374
00:10:59,200 --> 00:11:01,120
be turned into a skyscraper by just

375
00:11:01,120 --> 00:11:02,959
extruding and scaling and moving a

376
00:11:02,959 --> 00:11:04,399
little bit let's say we selected a few

377
00:11:04,399 --> 00:11:06,640
of these faces now like this

378
00:11:06,640 --> 00:11:08,320
there's also some tricks with extrusion

379
00:11:08,320 --> 00:11:10,640
here and if i were to press e to extrude

380
00:11:10,640 --> 00:11:11,920
now you can see that it just

381
00:11:11,920 --> 00:11:13,279
doesn't really know what to do it just

382
00:11:13,279 --> 00:11:15,519
slides it up and

383
00:11:15,519 --> 00:11:17,519
basically nothing really happened there

384
00:11:17,519 --> 00:11:19,600
so let's press ctrl z and try that again

385
00:11:19,600 --> 00:11:20,720
and this time we press

386
00:11:20,720 --> 00:11:24,000
alt e instead and then we do extrude

387
00:11:24,000 --> 00:11:27,200
faces along normals and now magically it

388
00:11:27,200 --> 00:11:28,000
just expands

389
00:11:28,000 --> 00:11:30,800
outwards the normal of a face is a line

390
00:11:30,800 --> 00:11:31,600
that faces

391
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:33,440
perpendicular to the surface of the

392
00:11:33,440 --> 00:11:35,600
object and by using extrude along

393
00:11:35,600 --> 00:11:37,920
normals it takes each face and goes oh

394
00:11:37,920 --> 00:11:39,680
my normal is this way well my normal is

395
00:11:39,680 --> 00:11:41,440
this way mineral is this way and mine

396
00:11:41,440 --> 00:11:43,120
and then it extrudes it that way instead

397
00:11:43,120 --> 00:11:44,560
there was another thing we spotted and

398
00:11:44,560 --> 00:11:45,600
that's if you do alt

399
00:11:45,600 --> 00:11:48,240
e again and then you do extrude

400
00:11:48,240 --> 00:11:48,880
individual

401
00:11:48,880 --> 00:11:52,000
faces and now suddenly it takes all four

402
00:11:52,000 --> 00:11:53,519
of those faces and extrudes them

403
00:11:53,519 --> 00:11:54,399
individually

404
00:11:54,399 --> 00:11:58,079
also really good now if we scale it

405
00:11:58,079 --> 00:11:59,920
remember now we've got the medium point

406
00:11:59,920 --> 00:12:02,000
which is why it scales it down

407
00:12:02,000 --> 00:12:03,200
so if you wanted to get rid of that

408
00:12:03,200 --> 00:12:05,279
remember we press period and switch to

409
00:12:05,279 --> 00:12:06,480
individual origins

410
00:12:06,480 --> 00:12:08,560
and now when i press scale it scales

411
00:12:08,560 --> 00:12:09,839
those down this would be a really

412
00:12:09,839 --> 00:12:11,120
strange skyscraper

413
00:12:11,120 --> 00:12:12,720
so we're not going to make a skyscraper

414
00:12:12,720 --> 00:12:14,240
out of this one there is one more method

415
00:12:14,240 --> 00:12:15,600
that you can use to extrude

416
00:12:15,600 --> 00:12:18,000
and if you select any face here i press

417
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:19,360
three on the keyboard into face select

418
00:12:19,360 --> 00:12:20,320
and i

419
00:12:20,320 --> 00:12:22,720
get this face here i can hold the ctrl

420
00:12:22,720 --> 00:12:24,160
key down and right click

421
00:12:24,160 --> 00:12:26,160
and that'll extrude it automatically to

422
00:12:26,160 --> 00:12:28,399
that location just hold the ctrl key

423
00:12:28,399 --> 00:12:30,880
and right click and that'll follow along

424
00:12:30,880 --> 00:12:32,399
one good thing to keep in mind here is

425
00:12:32,399 --> 00:12:32,959
if i

426
00:12:32,959 --> 00:12:35,040
select this face here and i press one on

427
00:12:35,040 --> 00:12:37,200
the keypad to go into front view

428
00:12:37,200 --> 00:12:39,120
now if i hold the ctrl key and right

429
00:12:39,120 --> 00:12:40,639
click i know that everything will be

430
00:12:40,639 --> 00:12:41,839
aligned

431
00:12:41,839 --> 00:12:43,839
perfectly let's rotate with the middle

432
00:12:43,839 --> 00:12:45,440
mouse button you can see that

433
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:48,079
and we can even go to the side view here

434
00:12:48,079 --> 00:12:49,680
you can see that it's perfectly straight

435
00:12:49,680 --> 00:12:50,560
this one behind

436
00:12:50,560 --> 00:12:52,000
be aware though that when you do this

437
00:12:52,000 --> 00:12:53,680
method you can

438
00:12:53,680 --> 00:12:55,360
so you don't go too sharp if i were to

439
00:12:55,360 --> 00:12:57,040
go too sharp here

440
00:12:57,040 --> 00:12:58,800
then you can see we have this back face

441
00:12:58,800 --> 00:13:01,120
problem that we described before

442
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:02,800
let's cancel out of this one controls

443
00:13:02,800 --> 00:13:04,399
that a whole bunch of times so we go

444
00:13:04,399 --> 00:13:05,760
back to here

445
00:13:05,760 --> 00:13:07,519
there's another hotkey that's really

446
00:13:07,519 --> 00:13:10,240
useful and that's to rotate things and r

447
00:13:10,240 --> 00:13:11,920
is the hotkey for that so if you just

448
00:13:11,920 --> 00:13:12,480
press

449
00:13:12,480 --> 00:13:14,240
r on a face here you can see that you

450
00:13:14,240 --> 00:13:16,320
can twist it

451
00:13:16,320 --> 00:13:18,800
here i'll select this one r to rotate it

452
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:19,440
and

453
00:13:19,440 --> 00:13:22,000
if i have multiple ones selected here

454
00:13:22,000 --> 00:13:22,880
and press r

455
00:13:22,880 --> 00:13:25,360
it'll rotate it you can combine r to

456
00:13:25,360 --> 00:13:27,200
rotate so if if we select this one and

457
00:13:27,200 --> 00:13:28,720
you do e to extrude

458
00:13:28,720 --> 00:13:31,279
and you press r to rotate e to extrude r

459
00:13:31,279 --> 00:13:32,959
to rotate e to extrude

460
00:13:32,959 --> 00:13:35,360
or to rotate this is also quite useful

461
00:13:35,360 --> 00:13:37,600
you can also rotate around a fixed axis

462
00:13:37,600 --> 00:13:40,240
so if i select this face i press e to

463
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:40,959
extrude it

464
00:13:40,959 --> 00:13:42,880
and then i press r to rotate it this

465
00:13:42,880 --> 00:13:45,199
also works for moving and scaling things

466
00:13:45,199 --> 00:13:46,880
but if i press the keyboard now to

467
00:13:46,880 --> 00:13:48,399
represent one of the axes like

468
00:13:48,399 --> 00:13:50,639
y for example to represent the green y

469
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,000
axis you can see that it created a

470
00:13:52,000 --> 00:13:52,959
guideline here

471
00:13:52,959 --> 00:13:55,199
and now it forces rotation around that

472
00:13:55,199 --> 00:13:56,639
axis if i were to

473
00:13:56,639 --> 00:13:59,199
switch to x it'll rotate around the

474
00:13:59,199 --> 00:14:00,639
x-axis and if i press

475
00:14:00,639 --> 00:14:03,199
z it'll rotate around the z axis and

476
00:14:03,199 --> 00:14:04,720
this is a really useful way

477
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,560
to force rotations if you want to do it

478
00:14:06,560 --> 00:14:08,160
around one axis

479
00:14:08,160 --> 00:14:10,880
also when you rotate you can type in the

480
00:14:10,880 --> 00:14:12,320
amount that you want to rotate if i

481
00:14:12,320 --> 00:14:14,160
press r to rotate

482
00:14:14,160 --> 00:14:17,040
i press y to rotate it around the y axis

483
00:14:17,040 --> 00:14:17,920
and then i just

484
00:14:17,920 --> 00:14:21,120
let go of the mouse now and i type 90.

485
00:14:21,120 --> 00:14:23,839
then it twists that face but be aware

486
00:14:23,839 --> 00:14:25,120
you don't want to rotate that much

487
00:14:25,120 --> 00:14:27,120
because it breaks the geometry so if we

488
00:14:27,120 --> 00:14:28,639
redo that one

489
00:14:28,639 --> 00:14:31,600
r to rotate y on the y axis and then

490
00:14:31,600 --> 00:14:32,160
type in

491
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:35,519
45 degrees okay another useful hotkey

492
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:37,760
for hard surface modeling is

493
00:14:37,760 --> 00:14:40,079
eye to inset so if i select this face

494
00:14:40,079 --> 00:14:42,160
and i press i to inset you can see that

495
00:14:42,160 --> 00:14:43,279
it just creates an

496
00:14:43,279 --> 00:14:46,399
inset face here and if i wanted to

497
00:14:46,399 --> 00:14:47,760
now we could extrude that one for

498
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:50,079
example and you can also after you do i

499
00:14:50,079 --> 00:14:50,880
to inset

500
00:14:50,880 --> 00:14:53,120
you can also extrude downwards to sync

501
00:14:53,120 --> 00:14:54,800
into the object

502
00:14:54,800 --> 00:14:59,120
i to inset b to extrude s to scale

503
00:14:59,120 --> 00:15:03,040
e to extrude i to inset e to extrude

504
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:04,959
and you could create like a sci-fi

505
00:15:04,959 --> 00:15:06,959
skyscraper or a building

506
00:15:06,959 --> 00:15:08,959
really fast doing this method so

507
00:15:08,959 --> 00:15:10,079
remember we've got

508
00:15:10,079 --> 00:15:13,360
g to move s to scale

509
00:15:13,360 --> 00:15:16,959
e to extrude i to inset and these keys

510
00:15:16,959 --> 00:15:17,279
are

511
00:15:17,279 --> 00:15:19,199
lethal when it comes to low poly

512
00:15:19,199 --> 00:15:20,639
modeling so you should really get the

513
00:15:20,639 --> 00:15:21,360
hang of those

514
00:15:21,360 --> 00:15:23,120
do it as much as possible when it comes

515
00:15:23,120 --> 00:15:24,399
to in setting as well

516
00:15:24,399 --> 00:15:26,560
let's say you select multiple faces like

517
00:15:26,560 --> 00:15:28,560
these i hold the shift key to select

518
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:29,920
multiple one

519
00:15:29,920 --> 00:15:31,839
if i press i to inset now you can see

520
00:15:31,839 --> 00:15:33,040
that it creates

521
00:15:33,040 --> 00:15:35,360
one single insert for all of these faces

522
00:15:35,360 --> 00:15:37,040
quite often this is the way you want it

523
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,120
like let's say we wanted to extrude that

524
00:15:39,120 --> 00:15:40,880
could be quite common maybe you have a

525
00:15:40,880 --> 00:15:42,800
building complex or a

526
00:15:42,800 --> 00:15:45,120
pentagon or something like that then you

527
00:15:45,120 --> 00:15:45,920
want to do that

528
00:15:45,920 --> 00:15:48,560
but sometimes when you do i to inset you

529
00:15:48,560 --> 00:15:49,360
can press i

530
00:15:49,360 --> 00:15:51,920
again and that makes individual

531
00:15:51,920 --> 00:15:53,199
insetting

532
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:55,199
and if you extrude those then suddenly

533
00:15:55,199 --> 00:15:57,279
you've created individual faces

534
00:15:57,279 --> 00:16:00,079
delete this one now i'll do shift a and

535
00:16:00,079 --> 00:16:01,680
create a new cube so we're back to where

536
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:02,639
we started

537
00:16:02,639 --> 00:16:04,480
let's say we wanted to make a skyscraper

538
00:16:04,480 --> 00:16:06,240
out of this one now i do go tab into

539
00:16:06,240 --> 00:16:07,279
edit mode

540
00:16:07,279 --> 00:16:09,839
maybe slide this one up let's press

541
00:16:09,839 --> 00:16:10,959
these two

542
00:16:10,959 --> 00:16:12,639
with the shift key scale and then i

543
00:16:12,639 --> 00:16:15,440
press x to scale it on the x axis

544
00:16:15,440 --> 00:16:17,360
here let's move this one up a little bit

545
00:16:17,360 --> 00:16:19,920
e to extrude s to scale e to extrude e

546
00:16:19,920 --> 00:16:20,560
to extrude

547
00:16:20,560 --> 00:16:22,720
s to scale e to extrude e to extrude s

548
00:16:22,720 --> 00:16:24,160
to scale e to extrude

549
00:16:24,160 --> 00:16:26,240
e to extrude s to scale let's say we

550
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,680
just have it like this now instead

551
00:16:27,680 --> 00:16:29,440
now you could create for example if you

552
00:16:29,440 --> 00:16:31,519
wanted to expand here e to extrude

553
00:16:31,519 --> 00:16:34,560
b to extrude e to extrude

554
00:16:34,560 --> 00:16:38,079
e to extrude and remember with inset now

555
00:16:38,079 --> 00:16:38,480
as well

556
00:16:38,480 --> 00:16:41,600
if i select a few of these faces i to

557
00:16:41,600 --> 00:16:42,720
inset

558
00:16:42,720 --> 00:16:44,399
and i've already got individual you can

559
00:16:44,399 --> 00:16:46,880
see at the top there individual is on

560
00:16:46,880 --> 00:16:48,639
so you toggle with the i again if you

561
00:16:48,639 --> 00:16:50,320
wanted to just inset it like this

562
00:16:50,320 --> 00:16:52,399
and you can inset it again and s to

563
00:16:52,399 --> 00:16:54,320
scale it you can start creating a lot of

564
00:16:54,320 --> 00:16:56,240
details on your objects by doing it this

565
00:16:56,240 --> 00:16:57,360
way

566
00:16:57,360 --> 00:16:59,600
and here let's say we wanted to create

567
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:00,880
an indentation for

568
00:17:00,880 --> 00:17:03,040
something that could look like a roof i

569
00:17:03,040 --> 00:17:04,559
hold the shift key and select these two

570
00:17:04,559 --> 00:17:05,359
faces

571
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:08,880
press i to inset e to extrude it down

572
00:17:08,880 --> 00:17:11,119
select these two with the shift key i to

573
00:17:11,119 --> 00:17:13,919
inset and e to extrude it down

574
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:15,199
so now we're starting to be able to

575
00:17:15,199 --> 00:17:17,199
model maybe a sci-fi city really fast

576
00:17:17,199 --> 00:17:18,720
this way i also want to show if you've

577
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:19,119
got

578
00:17:19,119 --> 00:17:20,799
the mirror modifier on this is another

579
00:17:20,799 --> 00:17:22,480
question i get a lot a lot

580
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,280
and you press i to inset sometimes you

581
00:17:25,280 --> 00:17:25,919
want

582
00:17:25,919 --> 00:17:29,120
this center face here not to appear and

583
00:17:29,120 --> 00:17:30,400
there's a hotkey for that

584
00:17:30,400 --> 00:17:32,400
and if you press i to inset and then you

585
00:17:32,400 --> 00:17:34,080
press b on your keyboard

586
00:17:34,080 --> 00:17:35,840
it'll magically remove that one if

587
00:17:35,840 --> 00:17:37,360
you're using the mirror modifier we're

588
00:17:37,360 --> 00:17:38,799
going to cover the mirror modifier later

589
00:17:38,799 --> 00:17:39,120
on

590
00:17:39,120 --> 00:17:41,120
just so you know now though that b is

591
00:17:41,120 --> 00:17:42,720
the hotkey for boundary

592
00:17:42,720 --> 00:17:44,559
and that way you'll get rid of that

593
00:17:44,559 --> 00:17:46,160
center face if

594
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:48,640
b doesn't work for you like this it

595
00:17:48,640 --> 00:17:50,080
could be because you've selected

596
00:17:50,080 --> 00:17:51,360
individual faces

597
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,520
so if i have these two selected i do i

598
00:17:53,520 --> 00:17:54,720
to inset

599
00:17:54,720 --> 00:17:58,400
i to inset again now suddenly i do it in

600
00:17:58,400 --> 00:17:59,440
set and then i want to do

601
00:17:59,440 --> 00:18:03,120
b it doesn't work and no matter how hard

602
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:03,760
you press b

603
00:18:03,760 --> 00:18:05,280
it won't work and that's because you've

604
00:18:05,280 --> 00:18:07,280
got individual on so toggle off

605
00:18:07,280 --> 00:18:08,240
individual first

606
00:18:08,240 --> 00:18:10,720
and now b works so just a little side

607
00:18:10,720 --> 00:18:11,360
note

608
00:18:11,360 --> 00:18:12,799
one more thing that's useful is

609
00:18:12,799 --> 00:18:14,799
proportional editing and that's a little

610
00:18:14,799 --> 00:18:15,919
thing up here

611
00:18:15,919 --> 00:18:17,919
you can press o which is a hotkey for

612
00:18:17,919 --> 00:18:19,520
proportional editing

613
00:18:19,520 --> 00:18:20,960
you should really learn these hotkeys by

614
00:18:20,960 --> 00:18:22,320
the way they'll save you a lot of time

615
00:18:22,320 --> 00:18:24,160
but you can also press up here

616
00:18:24,160 --> 00:18:26,160
and now when i press g you can see i've

617
00:18:26,160 --> 00:18:28,080
got a little circle around here and you

618
00:18:28,080 --> 00:18:30,000
can use the scroll wheel now to change

619
00:18:30,000 --> 00:18:30,960
the circle

620
00:18:30,960 --> 00:18:34,000
and this way we can proportionally edit

621
00:18:34,000 --> 00:18:35,440
the whole object here which is really

622
00:18:35,440 --> 00:18:37,200
useful maybe not for a skyscraper but

623
00:18:37,200 --> 00:18:38,400
there will be many times

624
00:18:38,400 --> 00:18:40,480
especially if i want to make some let's

625
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:41,760
say you had a little building and you

626
00:18:41,760 --> 00:18:43,360
wanted to make some more character on it

627
00:18:43,360 --> 00:18:44,559
or you were creating an

628
00:18:44,559 --> 00:18:45,919
island and you want to drag up the

629
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,600
surface or you're creating stones or

630
00:18:47,600 --> 00:18:48,480
something like that

631
00:18:48,480 --> 00:18:50,960
you can switch up here from different uh

632
00:18:50,960 --> 00:18:52,720
the default one here is smooth you could

633
00:18:52,720 --> 00:18:54,400
also do random for example

634
00:18:54,400 --> 00:18:55,919
and now when you move it'll start moving

635
00:18:55,919 --> 00:18:57,840
things randomly so that's also very

636
00:18:57,840 --> 00:18:58,480
useful

637
00:18:58,480 --> 00:18:59,919
let's put this a little bit to the test

638
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,919
now if i hide that one i

639
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:04,320
do shift a to add a new cube here and

640
00:19:04,320 --> 00:19:05,360
let's start fresh

641
00:19:05,360 --> 00:19:07,679
i'd like to go in fresh let's say you

642
00:19:07,679 --> 00:19:09,360
want to make a crate now let's make an

643
00:19:09,360 --> 00:19:10,000
actual object

644
00:19:10,000 --> 00:19:12,799
that we could be proud of when i create

645
00:19:12,799 --> 00:19:13,600
a new object

646
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:14,880
often you have to go back into the

647
00:19:14,880 --> 00:19:16,960
shading tab by the way and then

648
00:19:16,960 --> 00:19:18,880
when the object is selected you switch

649
00:19:18,880 --> 00:19:21,120
back to material if it disappears you

650
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:22,000
know why

651
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,360
it's because when you create a new

652
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,960
object it won't have that material by

653
00:19:24,960 --> 00:19:25,760
default

654
00:19:25,760 --> 00:19:27,280
now let's see what we've learned we

655
00:19:27,280 --> 00:19:29,200
press tab into edit mode

656
00:19:29,200 --> 00:19:31,280
a just make sure a to select everything

657
00:19:31,280 --> 00:19:34,480
here on the left side here i press a

658
00:19:34,480 --> 00:19:37,600
scale 0 and enter

659
00:19:37,600 --> 00:19:40,559
and i press g here to move these uvs

660
00:19:40,559 --> 00:19:41,360
it's called

661
00:19:41,360 --> 00:19:44,640
to here to make a brown box like a wood

662
00:19:44,640 --> 00:19:45,679
box

663
00:19:45,679 --> 00:19:48,080
i press three on the keyboard now and

664
00:19:48,080 --> 00:19:48,720
now i've got

665
00:19:48,720 --> 00:19:50,400
face select that's what we switched to

666
00:19:50,400 --> 00:19:53,360
with three here now we press i to inset

667
00:19:53,360 --> 00:19:55,280
and we had individual on from before

668
00:19:55,280 --> 00:19:56,720
normally you'd probably get to this

669
00:19:56,720 --> 00:19:58,000
where nothing is happening

670
00:19:58,000 --> 00:20:00,320
but when you press i again to switch on

671
00:20:00,320 --> 00:20:01,039
individual

672
00:20:01,039 --> 00:20:03,280
you get this magic here and then

673
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,640
remember what we learned something else

674
00:20:04,640 --> 00:20:05,200
we did

675
00:20:05,200 --> 00:20:08,559
alt e to extrude along face normals

676
00:20:08,559 --> 00:20:10,559
and i drag it in a little bit and now

677
00:20:10,559 --> 00:20:11,919
we've already created something that

678
00:20:11,919 --> 00:20:13,440
looks a little bit like a crate

679
00:20:13,440 --> 00:20:15,200
a box that brings us to another

680
00:20:15,200 --> 00:20:16,640
technique that we could do and

681
00:20:16,640 --> 00:20:18,960
if i select i press two on the keyboard

682
00:20:18,960 --> 00:20:20,000
and i hold the shift

683
00:20:20,000 --> 00:20:22,080
key to multiple select these edges here

684
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:23,919
now here's another thing

685
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:27,440
ctrl b is bevel and if i press that and

686
00:20:27,440 --> 00:20:28,480
drag a little bit

687
00:20:28,480 --> 00:20:30,640
it bevels the edges that i selected

688
00:20:30,640 --> 00:20:32,480
there is also a way to do if i select

689
00:20:32,480 --> 00:20:33,840
these at the bottom here i hold the

690
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:34,559
shift key

691
00:20:34,559 --> 00:20:37,360
ctrl b to bevel if you expand this

692
00:20:37,360 --> 00:20:38,720
little one at the bottom here

693
00:20:38,720 --> 00:20:40,240
you could actually increase the number

694
00:20:40,240 --> 00:20:41,760
of segments

695
00:20:41,760 --> 00:20:44,159
if you wanted it to be rounder when

696
00:20:44,159 --> 00:20:46,159
doing low poly i rarely use that but

697
00:20:46,159 --> 00:20:47,280
it's good to know that you could

698
00:20:47,280 --> 00:20:48,080
actually have more

699
00:20:48,080 --> 00:20:50,320
levels to this if you wanted to there's

700
00:20:50,320 --> 00:20:52,880
also something called shrink and flatten

701
00:20:52,880 --> 00:20:55,360
if i press three to get into uh face

702
00:20:55,360 --> 00:20:58,400
selector i select these faces

703
00:20:58,400 --> 00:21:01,280
and then i do alt s to shrink and

704
00:21:01,280 --> 00:21:02,480
flatten

705
00:21:02,480 --> 00:21:03,760
that's another method that you could do

706
00:21:03,760 --> 00:21:05,440
we've got actually proportional editing

707
00:21:05,440 --> 00:21:07,200
on random here now which is why it

708
00:21:07,200 --> 00:21:08,640
turned out a little bit weird so let's

709
00:21:08,640 --> 00:21:09,919
deselect and do alt

710
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:12,159
s and this basically shrinks and

711
00:21:12,159 --> 00:21:14,240
flattens these faces that i do it's

712
00:21:14,240 --> 00:21:16,080
different from scale because if i press

713
00:21:16,080 --> 00:21:18,799
s to scale it'll scale those faces only

714
00:21:18,799 --> 00:21:19,919
but if i do alt

715
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:22,559
s it'll take and shrink and flatten the

716
00:21:22,559 --> 00:21:24,080
whole mesh if i do it inwards it'll

717
00:21:24,080 --> 00:21:25,600
shrink it i've already mentioned it a

718
00:21:25,600 --> 00:21:26,400
few times but

719
00:21:26,400 --> 00:21:28,720
you can also create additional geometry

720
00:21:28,720 --> 00:21:30,400
so i've got this cube here

721
00:21:30,400 --> 00:21:33,360
selected and then if i do shift a when

722
00:21:33,360 --> 00:21:33,679
i've

723
00:21:33,679 --> 00:21:36,240
when i'm in edit mode remember i do

724
00:21:36,240 --> 00:21:39,120
shift a then i can add a cube

725
00:21:39,120 --> 00:21:40,960
and i'm still in the same object here

726
00:21:40,960 --> 00:21:42,159
but we've got

727
00:21:42,159 --> 00:21:44,159
additional geometry this is why it's

728
00:21:44,159 --> 00:21:45,600
already colored because we're in the

729
00:21:45,600 --> 00:21:46,720
same object now

730
00:21:46,720 --> 00:21:48,799
but we've got more geometry more mesh

731
00:21:48,799 --> 00:21:50,480
data in here if i do shift a

732
00:21:50,480 --> 00:21:52,880
again i could add an icosphere for

733
00:21:52,880 --> 00:21:54,559
example and let's move that one to the

734
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:54,960
side

735
00:21:54,960 --> 00:21:56,799
often when i model even if i do an

736
00:21:56,799 --> 00:21:58,640
entire island or a car or

737
00:21:58,640 --> 00:22:00,880
with loads of different parts i often

738
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:02,720
model it in the same object

739
00:22:02,720 --> 00:22:04,720
but i have these different meshes and

740
00:22:04,720 --> 00:22:05,919
when you press shift a

741
00:22:05,919 --> 00:22:07,919
it'll create the geometry wherever this

742
00:22:07,919 --> 00:22:09,600
3d cursor is i haven't really mentioned

743
00:22:09,600 --> 00:22:11,360
this 3d cursor it's just been sitting

744
00:22:11,360 --> 00:22:12,960
there in the center all the time you can

745
00:22:12,960 --> 00:22:14,000
place that one by

746
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:15,679
holding shift and right clicking

747
00:22:15,679 --> 00:22:17,440
somewhere and that'll move this cursor

748
00:22:17,440 --> 00:22:19,120
if you click on an object it'll actually

749
00:22:19,120 --> 00:22:20,559
figure out that you wanted it on that

750
00:22:20,559 --> 00:22:21,360
surface

751
00:22:21,360 --> 00:22:23,520
so when you add something let's shift

752
00:22:23,520 --> 00:22:24,640
right click there

753
00:22:24,640 --> 00:22:27,120
and then i do shift a and i add another

754
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,440
cube it'll place the center of that cube

755
00:22:29,440 --> 00:22:30,880
right there sometimes you want to have

756
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,720
really specific control of where you

757
00:22:32,720 --> 00:22:35,120
place this cursor so if i want it to be

758
00:22:35,120 --> 00:22:36,880
right in the center of this face here i

759
00:22:36,880 --> 00:22:39,200
have face select on here which is three

760
00:22:39,200 --> 00:22:40,640
on the keyboard then you can press

761
00:22:40,640 --> 00:22:43,760
shift s and do cursor to selected

762
00:22:43,760 --> 00:22:45,440
and that'll place that cursor right

763
00:22:45,440 --> 00:22:47,520
there and i often use that to place it

764
00:22:47,520 --> 00:22:48,799
exactly where i want it

765
00:22:48,799 --> 00:22:51,200
before i do a shift a and maybe i wanted

766
00:22:51,200 --> 00:22:53,200
to add a cone there

767
00:22:53,200 --> 00:22:54,960
also when you add stuff like this like

768
00:22:54,960 --> 00:22:56,720
the icosphere for example let's create a

769
00:22:56,720 --> 00:22:57,679
new icosphere

770
00:22:57,679 --> 00:23:00,159
shift right click over here shift a

771
00:23:00,159 --> 00:23:00,960
let's create

772
00:23:00,960 --> 00:23:03,760
an ico sphere then you have often when

773
00:23:03,760 --> 00:23:05,120
you create something you have the for

774
00:23:05,120 --> 00:23:06,880
example subdivisions here you can

775
00:23:06,880 --> 00:23:08,640
step this up if you want more or less

776
00:23:08,640 --> 00:23:10,559
detail and if you don't see this one

777
00:23:10,559 --> 00:23:11,919
it's probably because it's collapsed

778
00:23:11,919 --> 00:23:13,280
down here so you have to click on this

779
00:23:13,280 --> 00:23:14,480
expansion thing

780
00:23:14,480 --> 00:23:16,320
now we can use what we've learned let's

781
00:23:16,320 --> 00:23:18,480
delete everything that we've done so far

782
00:23:18,480 --> 00:23:20,960
this building gone if you want to

783
00:23:20,960 --> 00:23:23,200
re-center this 3d cursor to the center

784
00:23:23,200 --> 00:23:23,760
you can press

785
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:25,840
shift c to re-center it down here in

786
00:23:25,840 --> 00:23:26,880
this scene let's

787
00:23:26,880 --> 00:23:29,919
shift a add a cube we're going to make a

788
00:23:29,919 --> 00:23:30,880
tree now

789
00:23:30,880 --> 00:23:33,760
so i tab into edit mode or first we need

790
00:23:33,760 --> 00:23:35,200
to go into the shading tab because this

791
00:23:35,200 --> 00:23:36,880
time we created a whole new object so we

792
00:23:36,880 --> 00:23:38,960
lost this material setting so i

793
00:23:38,960 --> 00:23:41,360
switch back to the material go back into

794
00:23:41,360 --> 00:23:43,200
this uv editing here

795
00:23:43,200 --> 00:23:46,799
let's do a on the left side scale 0

796
00:23:46,799 --> 00:23:49,200
press enter g to move this little dot

797
00:23:49,200 --> 00:23:50,080
here as well

798
00:23:50,080 --> 00:23:53,360
onto brown and now let's create a tree

799
00:23:53,360 --> 00:23:55,039
how we learned we scale this down a

800
00:23:55,039 --> 00:23:56,240
little bit

801
00:23:56,240 --> 00:23:57,919
maybe i view a little bit from the side

802
00:23:57,919 --> 00:24:00,080
i press control and i right click

803
00:24:00,080 --> 00:24:02,400
s to scale ctrl to right click s to

804
00:24:02,400 --> 00:24:04,240
scale control to right click

805
00:24:04,240 --> 00:24:06,960
s to scale g to move it if you want

806
00:24:06,960 --> 00:24:09,520
purposely i made a small step here

807
00:24:09,520 --> 00:24:11,840
because now when i select a side face

808
00:24:11,840 --> 00:24:12,960
here i can press

809
00:24:12,960 --> 00:24:15,200
either e to extrude it or i can look

810
00:24:15,200 --> 00:24:16,880
from the side here and control

811
00:24:16,880 --> 00:24:19,279
right click and then s to scale it to

812
00:24:19,279 --> 00:24:20,640
extrude that one

813
00:24:20,640 --> 00:24:22,320
you can even do two branches at the same

814
00:24:22,320 --> 00:24:24,159
time with what we've learned if i select

815
00:24:24,159 --> 00:24:27,440
a shift select these two and i do alt e

816
00:24:27,440 --> 00:24:30,480
and extrude individual faces and s to

817
00:24:30,480 --> 00:24:32,159
scale them

818
00:24:32,159 --> 00:24:33,440
and remember if you don't want it to

819
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:35,039
scale down towards the medium point here

820
00:24:35,039 --> 00:24:35,840
in the center

821
00:24:35,840 --> 00:24:37,520
you press period and you go to

822
00:24:37,520 --> 00:24:39,200
individual origins and then you try

823
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:40,880
scaling again

824
00:24:40,880 --> 00:24:42,080
and when you have these two phases

825
00:24:42,080 --> 00:24:43,600
selected you can actually move them up

826
00:24:43,600 --> 00:24:45,279
at the same time you could press r to

827
00:24:45,279 --> 00:24:47,279
rotate them together

828
00:24:47,279 --> 00:24:49,440
and you could press alt e to extrude

829
00:24:49,440 --> 00:24:52,320
this time we'll do along face normals

830
00:24:52,320 --> 00:24:54,720
and g to move it up so now we've created

831
00:24:54,720 --> 00:24:56,159
a basic stem of a tree

832
00:24:56,159 --> 00:24:58,240
and then i wanted to create some leaves

833
00:24:58,240 --> 00:24:59,679
here as well and we've learned

834
00:24:59,679 --> 00:25:01,919
most of that as well so if i shift and

835
00:25:01,919 --> 00:25:04,080
right click at the tip here of that face

836
00:25:04,080 --> 00:25:06,880
it placed my 3d cursor up here and then

837
00:25:06,880 --> 00:25:07,360
we do

838
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:09,440
shift a because we want to we're still

839
00:25:09,440 --> 00:25:10,960
in this object remember now

840
00:25:10,960 --> 00:25:13,360
but i do shift a and let's add that ico

841
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:14,799
sphere again

842
00:25:14,799 --> 00:25:16,320
and we can play around with how many

843
00:25:16,320 --> 00:25:18,240
subdivisions we want but let's keep it

844
00:25:18,240 --> 00:25:20,640
low poly looking so we'll keep it at two

845
00:25:20,640 --> 00:25:21,440
and then i can press

846
00:25:21,440 --> 00:25:24,240
s to scale this whole thing up now and

847
00:25:24,240 --> 00:25:25,760
here's the beauty thing that we learned

848
00:25:25,760 --> 00:25:26,400
before about

849
00:25:26,400 --> 00:25:28,320
quick colorization now if i go to the

850
00:25:28,320 --> 00:25:30,240
left side here hover with the mouse

851
00:25:30,240 --> 00:25:33,039
press a to select everything here s to

852
00:25:33,039 --> 00:25:33,840
scale it

853
00:25:33,840 --> 00:25:36,880
and 0 press enter and then

854
00:25:36,880 --> 00:25:39,840
still over here g to move it and move it

855
00:25:39,840 --> 00:25:40,480
to green

856
00:25:40,480 --> 00:25:42,159
now we're coming to a really important

857
00:25:42,159 --> 00:25:43,760
method when we want to select something

858
00:25:43,760 --> 00:25:45,279
since we're in this same

859
00:25:45,279 --> 00:25:47,440
cube object here but we've got two sets

860
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:49,279
of geometries we've got the tree trunk

861
00:25:49,279 --> 00:25:51,120
and we've got this ball of leaves here

862
00:25:51,120 --> 00:25:52,559
instead of selecting all of this

863
00:25:52,559 --> 00:25:54,400
individually with shift now

864
00:25:54,400 --> 00:25:57,200
there's an extremely extremely extremely

865
00:25:57,200 --> 00:25:58,799
useful thing you should definitely learn

866
00:25:58,799 --> 00:25:59,360
this one

867
00:25:59,360 --> 00:26:02,240
and that's the l hotkey if i hover the

868
00:26:02,240 --> 00:26:02,720
mouse

869
00:26:02,720 --> 00:26:04,720
over this ball of leaves and then i

870
00:26:04,720 --> 00:26:05,840
press l

871
00:26:05,840 --> 00:26:08,320
it'll magically select all of those and

872
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:09,120
that that's

873
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:11,840
select linked since all of these

874
00:26:11,840 --> 00:26:14,000
vertices are connected to each other

875
00:26:14,000 --> 00:26:16,080
if i press one on the keyboard you can

876
00:26:16,080 --> 00:26:17,120
see all of these have

877
00:26:17,120 --> 00:26:19,760
lines connecting to each other but none

878
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:21,600
of them have any lines that connect or

879
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,600
vertices that connect to this tree trunk

880
00:26:23,600 --> 00:26:25,440
and that's how blender will know that if

881
00:26:25,440 --> 00:26:27,440
you press l while hovering over one of

882
00:26:27,440 --> 00:26:28,000
these

883
00:26:28,000 --> 00:26:30,000
it'll select all of these and as i said

884
00:26:30,000 --> 00:26:31,520
i often model in

885
00:26:31,520 --> 00:26:33,440
the same object here but with multiple

886
00:26:33,440 --> 00:26:34,799
features like on the tree here for

887
00:26:34,799 --> 00:26:35,600
example

888
00:26:35,600 --> 00:26:38,240
and this is by far the most effective

889
00:26:38,240 --> 00:26:38,960
way i've

890
00:26:38,960 --> 00:26:41,360
found to uh to quickly model things in

891
00:26:41,360 --> 00:26:42,320
the same object

892
00:26:42,320 --> 00:26:43,840
that'll bring us to another hotkey and

893
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:46,240
that's shift d to duplicate things

894
00:26:46,240 --> 00:26:46,720
because

895
00:26:46,720 --> 00:26:48,320
we want to have a ball of leaves here

896
00:26:48,320 --> 00:26:50,559
and here as well and now if i press

897
00:26:50,559 --> 00:26:53,039
shift d i can duplicate this and it'll

898
00:26:53,039 --> 00:26:54,720
follow my mouse now and we can try to

899
00:26:54,720 --> 00:26:55,919
place it a little bit here

900
00:26:55,919 --> 00:26:57,440
but sometimes we have to tweak a little

901
00:26:57,440 --> 00:26:59,200
bit but let's place it there

902
00:26:59,200 --> 00:27:00,880
and we can use this gizmo remember we

903
00:27:00,880 --> 00:27:02,240
enabled that one up here so it's

904
00:27:02,240 --> 00:27:03,360
permanent

905
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,760
we up here we've got the move object

906
00:27:05,760 --> 00:27:06,640
gizmo

907
00:27:06,640 --> 00:27:08,320
so we can move it just along these

908
00:27:08,320 --> 00:27:10,400
axises here to make sure that it's

909
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,120
pretty good and then again shift d we

910
00:27:13,120 --> 00:27:14,880
move it to here

911
00:27:14,880 --> 00:27:17,520
okay we need to align it a little bit so

912
00:27:17,520 --> 00:27:20,000
let's move it into place

913
00:27:20,000 --> 00:27:23,039
like that and now we could press l

914
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,120
to select these and if i press l over

915
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:26,320
that one it'll add that one

916
00:27:26,320 --> 00:27:28,960
and l over that one and now you can also

917
00:27:28,960 --> 00:27:30,159
you can actually press shift

918
00:27:30,159 --> 00:27:32,080
l to deselect that works the opposite

919
00:27:32,080 --> 00:27:33,520
way

920
00:27:33,520 --> 00:27:36,000
and if i press l here now and s to scale

921
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:36,559
it

922
00:27:36,559 --> 00:27:40,080
r to rotate here i press l to select it

923
00:27:40,080 --> 00:27:42,799
s to scale it r to rotate just randomize

924
00:27:42,799 --> 00:27:44,640
it a little bit l to select it

925
00:27:44,640 --> 00:27:47,120
s to scale it and r to rotate remember

926
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:48,080
we also learned this

927
00:27:48,080 --> 00:27:50,000
proportional thing that was quite useful

928
00:27:50,000 --> 00:27:51,279
so we press o

929
00:27:51,279 --> 00:27:53,360
or click up here o toggles the

930
00:27:53,360 --> 00:27:54,799
proportional editing

931
00:27:54,799 --> 00:27:56,880
and if i select this vertex now and

932
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:58,240
press g

933
00:27:58,240 --> 00:27:59,679
you can see that i can move this and it

934
00:27:59,679 --> 00:28:01,600
proportionally edits the tree trino so

935
00:28:01,600 --> 00:28:02,080
remember

936
00:28:02,080 --> 00:28:03,919
you can use the scroll wheel now to

937
00:28:03,919 --> 00:28:05,600
scroll this in and out

938
00:28:05,600 --> 00:28:07,679
and see how much it should affect and

939
00:28:07,679 --> 00:28:09,440
here we see something that when i scale

940
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:11,279
this one up it starts dragging the tree

941
00:28:11,279 --> 00:28:13,279
branches or the tree trunk as well

942
00:28:13,279 --> 00:28:15,360
sometimes you don't want that and with

943
00:28:15,360 --> 00:28:17,120
proportional there's something called

944
00:28:17,120 --> 00:28:19,120
connected if we click on this one again

945
00:28:19,120 --> 00:28:21,120
you can select connected only here and

946
00:28:21,120 --> 00:28:22,640
that's pretty similar to how

947
00:28:22,640 --> 00:28:25,840
l uses to select things now when we do g

948
00:28:25,840 --> 00:28:28,080
to move it and you see that there's a

949
00:28:28,080 --> 00:28:30,159
hollow point here in the center and that

950
00:28:30,159 --> 00:28:31,760
means that it will only affect

951
00:28:31,760 --> 00:28:34,080
the vertices that are linked together so

952
00:28:34,080 --> 00:28:35,440
that are not connected

953
00:28:35,440 --> 00:28:37,039
so if you just wanted to change this

954
00:28:37,039 --> 00:28:38,640
ball of leaves and nothing else

955
00:28:38,640 --> 00:28:40,399
then you can use that method so let's

956
00:28:40,399 --> 00:28:42,960
use this one to g to move it

957
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:45,200
g to move it and now remember you could

958
00:28:45,200 --> 00:28:47,279
also toggle here to random

959
00:28:47,279 --> 00:28:48,960
and that's becoming quite useful because

960
00:28:48,960 --> 00:28:50,399
now when we drag it it'll do a little

961
00:28:50,399 --> 00:28:52,799
bit random

962
00:28:52,799 --> 00:28:54,720
be careful so you don't move it too far

963
00:28:54,720 --> 00:28:56,640
so you start breaking the geometry you

964
00:28:56,640 --> 00:28:58,080
see you have some overlapping

965
00:28:58,080 --> 00:29:00,000
lines here so ctrl z you'll have to

966
00:29:00,000 --> 00:29:01,760
avoid that at all times you don't ever

967
00:29:01,760 --> 00:29:02,159
want

968
00:29:02,159 --> 00:29:03,679
intersecting lines like that you can

969
00:29:03,679 --> 00:29:05,440
also do proportional editing with

970
00:29:05,440 --> 00:29:07,919
r to rotate and then remember you could

971
00:29:07,919 --> 00:29:08,720
press z

972
00:29:08,720 --> 00:29:10,559
to lock it on the z scale here and then

973
00:29:10,559 --> 00:29:12,320
scroll down with the scroll wheel

974
00:29:12,320 --> 00:29:14,640
you can add some twists to the trees

975
00:29:14,640 --> 00:29:15,440
here as well

976
00:29:15,440 --> 00:29:18,320
archer rotates

977
00:29:20,000 --> 00:29:23,520
or to rotate and set sometimes you still

978
00:29:23,520 --> 00:29:25,200
want to have if you do alt o is the

979
00:29:25,200 --> 00:29:26,880
hotkey for this connected thing if you

980
00:29:26,880 --> 00:29:28,399
still wanted it to affect the tree trunk

981
00:29:28,399 --> 00:29:29,039
again

982
00:29:29,039 --> 00:29:31,200
then g to move it and you could totally

983
00:29:31,200 --> 00:29:33,360
reshape this tree

984
00:29:33,360 --> 00:29:35,919
all together

985
00:29:37,600 --> 00:29:39,120
now we're going to deep dive into some

986
00:29:39,120 --> 00:29:40,960
more selection methods because

987
00:29:40,960 --> 00:29:42,480
we've learned some of the basic modeling

988
00:29:42,480 --> 00:29:44,399
techniques now so i'd say

989
00:29:44,399 --> 00:29:46,480
most important of all in addition to the

990
00:29:46,480 --> 00:29:47,440
modeling techniques

991
00:29:47,440 --> 00:29:49,279
is the different selection methods

992
00:29:49,279 --> 00:29:50,480
because you're going to be spending a

993
00:29:50,480 --> 00:29:52,399
lot of time selecting and deselecting

994
00:29:52,399 --> 00:29:52,799
things

995
00:29:52,799 --> 00:29:54,559
in order to do some operations on them

996
00:29:54,559 --> 00:29:56,399
in fact you'll save immense

997
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,159
insane incredible amounts of time by

998
00:29:58,159 --> 00:29:59,279
learning these different selection

999
00:29:59,279 --> 00:29:59,919
methods

1000
00:29:59,919 --> 00:30:01,840
when you do low poly modeling everything

1001
00:30:01,840 --> 00:30:03,520
is about to finding a quick selection

1002
00:30:03,520 --> 00:30:04,880
method to select what you want and

1003
00:30:04,880 --> 00:30:06,320
figuring out the right operation to

1004
00:30:06,320 --> 00:30:08,000
modify those selections

1005
00:30:08,000 --> 00:30:10,320
either to extrude or scale or modify

1006
00:30:10,320 --> 00:30:11,919
them flatten them or something like that

1007
00:30:11,919 --> 00:30:14,240
so a few things we already did l to

1008
00:30:14,240 --> 00:30:15,360
select the linked

1009
00:30:15,360 --> 00:30:17,520
very useful we know how to already click

1010
00:30:17,520 --> 00:30:18,559
on things like this

1011
00:30:18,559 --> 00:30:20,159
and holding shift to click on them to

1012
00:30:20,159 --> 00:30:22,320
select and toggle multiple selections

1013
00:30:22,320 --> 00:30:23,760
the next thing i want to show you is

1014
00:30:23,760 --> 00:30:26,399
loop select and if i go into

1015
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:28,000
face select here which is three on the

1016
00:30:28,000 --> 00:30:30,559
keyboard i can hold the alt key now

1017
00:30:30,559 --> 00:30:31,600
which is a loop select

1018
00:30:31,600 --> 00:30:33,760
and i click on this edge here and now

1019
00:30:33,760 --> 00:30:36,080
it's selected everything around here so

1020
00:30:36,080 --> 00:30:37,760
instead of having to click here

1021
00:30:37,760 --> 00:30:39,360
and holding the shift key and rotating

1022
00:30:39,360 --> 00:30:41,600
around instead of doing that

1023
00:30:41,600 --> 00:30:43,360
hold the alt key and just click on one

1024
00:30:43,360 --> 00:30:44,880
of these edges in between

1025
00:30:44,880 --> 00:30:46,720
and that loops selects around and that

1026
00:30:46,720 --> 00:30:48,159
also works in this direction

1027
00:30:48,159 --> 00:30:49,760
it selects the whole loop around the

1028
00:30:49,760 --> 00:30:51,760
tree here another method

1029
00:30:51,760 --> 00:30:54,799
is to press c for circle select

1030
00:30:54,799 --> 00:30:56,320
and that brings this little circle up

1031
00:30:56,320 --> 00:30:57,679
that you can change the size of with the

1032
00:30:57,679 --> 00:30:58,559
scroll wheel

1033
00:30:58,559 --> 00:31:00,559
and then basically just paint over which

1034
00:31:00,559 --> 00:31:02,159
ones you want to select

1035
00:31:02,159 --> 00:31:03,360
and then you press the middle mouse

1036
00:31:03,360 --> 00:31:04,960
button if you want to deselect things so

1037
00:31:04,960 --> 00:31:06,240
you could just paint a little bit there

1038
00:31:06,240 --> 00:31:07,440
paint a little bit there

1039
00:31:07,440 --> 00:31:08,799
paint a little bit there oop maybe not

1040
00:31:08,799 --> 00:31:10,080
that so you press the middle mouse

1041
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:10,559
button

1042
00:31:10,559 --> 00:31:12,080
and then you have to remember that when

1043
00:31:12,080 --> 00:31:13,519
you're finished with this you press

1044
00:31:13,519 --> 00:31:14,159
enter

1045
00:31:14,159 --> 00:31:15,840
and then that selection is remembered

1046
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:17,600
for you so if you wanted to do

1047
00:31:17,600 --> 00:31:19,279
something like extrude that for example

1048
00:31:19,279 --> 00:31:21,519
e to extrude it or s to scale it now

1049
00:31:21,519 --> 00:31:22,960
we've got proportional that's why it's

1050
00:31:22,960 --> 00:31:24,720
do not let's disable that

1051
00:31:24,720 --> 00:31:28,000
scale it so circle select is very useful

1052
00:31:28,000 --> 00:31:28,640
as well

1053
00:31:28,640 --> 00:31:30,480
in edge mode you can also do something

1054
00:31:30,480 --> 00:31:31,760
called ring select

1055
00:31:31,760 --> 00:31:34,640
and if i go here i have two pressed or

1056
00:31:34,640 --> 00:31:35,919
go into edge select

1057
00:31:35,919 --> 00:31:39,279
and then i do alt control and i click on

1058
00:31:39,279 --> 00:31:39,840
one of these

1059
00:31:39,840 --> 00:31:42,799
it selects the ring around these you can

1060
00:31:42,799 --> 00:31:43,519
also do

1061
00:31:43,519 --> 00:31:46,159
loop select which is alt and click on

1062
00:31:46,159 --> 00:31:46,640
that one

1063
00:31:46,640 --> 00:31:49,120
and that selects the loop round you can

1064
00:31:49,120 --> 00:31:50,480
also use the control key

1065
00:31:50,480 --> 00:31:53,120
to select the shortest path to something

1066
00:31:53,120 --> 00:31:53,760
if i have

1067
00:31:53,760 --> 00:31:55,519
edge select here i press two to make

1068
00:31:55,519 --> 00:31:56,880
sure i'm in edge select and i select

1069
00:31:56,880 --> 00:31:57,760
that edge

1070
00:31:57,760 --> 00:31:59,519
and then i select an edge over here and

1071
00:31:59,519 --> 00:32:01,760
i press ctrl it'll select the shortest

1072
00:32:01,760 --> 00:32:02,480
path

1073
00:32:02,480 --> 00:32:05,039
to that one here i select this one

1074
00:32:05,039 --> 00:32:05,760
control

1075
00:32:05,760 --> 00:32:08,000
and select so shortest path also very

1076
00:32:08,000 --> 00:32:10,240
useful another one i use a lot is box

1077
00:32:10,240 --> 00:32:11,039
select

1078
00:32:11,039 --> 00:32:13,279
so if i go into one here to see the

1079
00:32:13,279 --> 00:32:14,480
vertex mode

1080
00:32:14,480 --> 00:32:16,480
double click a to deselect everything

1081
00:32:16,480 --> 00:32:18,720
press b on the keyboard to box select

1082
00:32:18,720 --> 00:32:19,679
things

1083
00:32:19,679 --> 00:32:21,519
really fast way to get and see that it

1084
00:32:21,519 --> 00:32:23,360
doesn't pick the back faces here

1085
00:32:23,360 --> 00:32:24,799
if you wanted to include all the back

1086
00:32:24,799 --> 00:32:26,799
purchases i do that quite often

1087
00:32:26,799 --> 00:32:29,279
i'll double click a maybe i'll go into

1088
00:32:29,279 --> 00:32:30,159
front view

1089
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:32,240
with one on the keypad and then i press

1090
00:32:32,240 --> 00:32:34,720
alt z to enable x-ray

1091
00:32:34,720 --> 00:32:37,279
and now when i press b to box select and

1092
00:32:37,279 --> 00:32:38,000
i slice

1093
00:32:38,000 --> 00:32:39,760
something like that for example then you

1094
00:32:39,760 --> 00:32:41,440
can toggle back from alt set

1095
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,880
and now it's selected all of those

1096
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,960
vertices around there so maybe you

1097
00:32:44,960 --> 00:32:47,039
wanted to just select those to do

1098
00:32:47,039 --> 00:32:49,440
maybe you wanted to g to move them up or

1099
00:32:49,440 --> 00:32:51,279
e to extrude them and has to scale them

1100
00:32:51,279 --> 00:32:52,080
down

1101
00:32:52,080 --> 00:32:54,159
for whatever reason b to box select is

1102
00:32:54,159 --> 00:32:55,760
very useful that's very useful

1103
00:32:55,760 --> 00:32:57,600
especially from an orthographic

1104
00:32:57,600 --> 00:32:59,519
side view like this where you really

1105
00:32:59,519 --> 00:33:01,200
want to select if you had a

1106
00:33:01,200 --> 00:33:02,960
like an island for example with loads of

1107
00:33:02,960 --> 00:33:04,640
vertices across the ground

1108
00:33:04,640 --> 00:33:06,399
then it's useful to use that method

1109
00:33:06,399 --> 00:33:08,000
another one useful is

1110
00:33:08,000 --> 00:33:11,279
lasso select again if i do alt z

1111
00:33:11,279 --> 00:33:13,679
to see through here the x-ray double

1112
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:14,880
click a to make sure everything is

1113
00:33:14,880 --> 00:33:16,159
deselected

1114
00:33:16,159 --> 00:33:18,640
now i hold the control key and i use the

1115
00:33:18,640 --> 00:33:21,039
right mouse button to draw around here

1116
00:33:21,039 --> 00:33:22,960
this is lasso select if you want it to

1117
00:33:22,960 --> 00:33:24,880
really be precise like this

1118
00:33:24,880 --> 00:33:26,559
well i do it often and quite fast like

1119
00:33:26,559 --> 00:33:28,960
this as well even if you wanted to just

1120
00:33:28,960 --> 00:33:32,240
select a few regions if i double click a

1121
00:33:32,240 --> 00:33:32,960
here

1122
00:33:32,960 --> 00:33:36,000
alt z you can use ctrl right click

1123
00:33:36,000 --> 00:33:37,760
to just lasso select a few of these

1124
00:33:37,760 --> 00:33:39,440
vertices if you wanted to

1125
00:33:39,440 --> 00:33:42,159
just select a few of them another useful

1126
00:33:42,159 --> 00:33:45,039
one is to grow and shrink your selection

1127
00:33:45,039 --> 00:33:47,440
if i press 3 on the keypad i select

1128
00:33:47,440 --> 00:33:49,279
maybe i select that face alone if i

1129
00:33:49,279 --> 00:33:49,600
press

1130
00:33:49,600 --> 00:33:52,880
ctrl plus on the keypad now it'll grow

1131
00:33:52,880 --> 00:33:53,919
that selection by

1132
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:55,360
everything that's enabling that

1133
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,760
selection if i press ctrl plus again

1134
00:33:57,760 --> 00:33:59,679
it'll expand it again

1135
00:33:59,679 --> 00:34:01,279
this is a quick method let's say i

1136
00:34:01,279 --> 00:34:02,960
wanted to select i hold the shift key

1137
00:34:02,960 --> 00:34:04,559
select a few of these top ones

1138
00:34:04,559 --> 00:34:06,799
ctrl plus a few times and now we've

1139
00:34:06,799 --> 00:34:08,480
magically selected all the top

1140
00:34:08,480 --> 00:34:10,399
parts here if i wanted to e to extrude

1141
00:34:10,399 --> 00:34:12,719
it or maybe s to scale it

1142
00:34:12,719 --> 00:34:14,480
e to extrude it maybe i wanted to create

1143
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,560
snow cap here

1144
00:34:16,560 --> 00:34:19,199
like this yeah that's very useful to

1145
00:34:19,199 --> 00:34:20,000
grow and shrink

1146
00:34:20,000 --> 00:34:21,520
the selection oh wait i said shrink

1147
00:34:21,520 --> 00:34:23,839
selection now because you can equally do

1148
00:34:23,839 --> 00:34:26,879
control minus here to shrink it so

1149
00:34:26,879 --> 00:34:28,800
control plus expands it and control

1150
00:34:28,800 --> 00:34:30,639
minus shrinks it

1151
00:34:30,639 --> 00:34:32,239
since we're on the topic of selection

1152
00:34:32,239 --> 00:34:33,918
here's another tip you can select the

1153
00:34:33,918 --> 00:34:35,199
random stuff as well

1154
00:34:35,199 --> 00:34:37,119
so if we double click a nothing is

1155
00:34:37,119 --> 00:34:39,599
selected i go to select here

1156
00:34:39,599 --> 00:34:41,918
and then select random it selects a

1157
00:34:41,918 --> 00:34:43,359
random number of faces

1158
00:34:43,359 --> 00:34:45,040
and here you can increase and decrease

1159
00:34:45,040 --> 00:34:46,800
the number of percent of randomness that

1160
00:34:46,800 --> 00:34:48,480
you want maybe you only wanted a quarter

1161
00:34:48,480 --> 00:34:50,719
of them selected or maybe you wanted

1162
00:34:50,719 --> 00:34:53,199
75 selected another thing we can do is

1163
00:34:53,199 --> 00:34:54,719
select similar ones

1164
00:34:54,719 --> 00:34:58,079
so if i select this one and do shift g

1165
00:34:58,079 --> 00:35:00,400
we can select similar faces let's do for

1166
00:35:00,400 --> 00:35:02,560
example polygon sites now it's selected

1167
00:35:02,560 --> 00:35:03,599
everything that had

1168
00:35:03,599 --> 00:35:05,760
three three edges to the polygon so it

1169
00:35:05,760 --> 00:35:07,280
didn't select anything on the tree trunk

1170
00:35:07,280 --> 00:35:08,079
because that's

1171
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:11,119
got more four it's uh four edges

1172
00:35:11,119 --> 00:35:13,280
we could also do shift g we have to have

1173
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:14,480
one selected by the way

1174
00:35:14,480 --> 00:35:16,560
at least before you press shift g for

1175
00:35:16,560 --> 00:35:17,760
the similar one

1176
00:35:17,760 --> 00:35:20,720
maybe we wanted to do normal okay

1177
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:21,839
nothing was selected

1178
00:35:21,839 --> 00:35:24,000
so maybe we increased this threshold and

1179
00:35:24,000 --> 00:35:25,680
now we can see that it's selected faces

1180
00:35:25,680 --> 00:35:27,200
that were facing this one

1181
00:35:27,200 --> 00:35:28,960
so again if we wanted to do the snow cap

1182
00:35:28,960 --> 00:35:31,200
i could just select one face here

1183
00:35:31,200 --> 00:35:34,640
press shift g normal and then use the

1184
00:35:34,640 --> 00:35:36,480
slider here for the threshold to say

1185
00:35:36,480 --> 00:35:38,000
okay that's how much we want to be snow

1186
00:35:38,000 --> 00:35:39,760
covered now it also picked some of this

1187
00:35:39,760 --> 00:35:41,119
tree trunk here as well but maybe we

1188
00:35:41,119 --> 00:35:42,079
wanted

1189
00:35:42,079 --> 00:35:45,359
something there i do alt e extrude along

1190
00:35:45,359 --> 00:35:47,599
phase normals

1191
00:35:47,599 --> 00:35:49,440
and let's say we also see that didn't

1192
00:35:49,440 --> 00:35:51,200
actually when we extruded now we didn't

1193
00:35:51,200 --> 00:35:53,119
have this edge selected but we want this

1194
00:35:53,119 --> 00:35:54,320
to be snow as well

1195
00:35:54,320 --> 00:35:56,320
then remember here's where control plus

1196
00:35:56,320 --> 00:35:58,480
is really useful now it added that

1197
00:35:58,480 --> 00:36:00,720
it expanded the selection to include all

1198
00:36:00,720 --> 00:36:02,160
the neighboring ones

1199
00:36:02,160 --> 00:36:04,160
and then here on the left now you can

1200
00:36:04,160 --> 00:36:05,760
see that it's combined we've got some

1201
00:36:05,760 --> 00:36:07,280
faces that are brown

1202
00:36:07,280 --> 00:36:09,520
and some that are green so to fix that

1203
00:36:09,520 --> 00:36:11,280
one we can do a quick operation on the

1204
00:36:11,280 --> 00:36:12,079
left here

1205
00:36:12,079 --> 00:36:13,680
so while the mouse is over here on the

1206
00:36:13,680 --> 00:36:15,200
left press

1207
00:36:15,200 --> 00:36:16,960
s to scale it while they're selected and

1208
00:36:16,960 --> 00:36:18,480
then zero

1209
00:36:18,480 --> 00:36:20,000
and now it shrunk it down to yellow

1210
00:36:20,000 --> 00:36:21,520
because that was the medium point here

1211
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:22,400
but i can press

1212
00:36:22,400 --> 00:36:25,119
g to move it to white and now we've snow

1213
00:36:25,119 --> 00:36:26,000
covered everything

1214
00:36:26,000 --> 00:36:28,640
that was similar facing to what we

1215
00:36:28,640 --> 00:36:29,680
selected before

1216
00:36:29,680 --> 00:36:31,599
so play around with shift g and you can

1217
00:36:31,599 --> 00:36:33,520
select different things here try to find

1218
00:36:33,520 --> 00:36:35,200
methods that work there's also something

1219
00:36:35,200 --> 00:36:37,680
called checker deselect which is useful

1220
00:36:37,680 --> 00:36:39,440
if i press l here to select all of these

1221
00:36:39,440 --> 00:36:41,440
linked ones and then i do f3

1222
00:36:41,440 --> 00:36:44,400
and i type in checker deselect then you

1223
00:36:44,400 --> 00:36:46,000
can see that it

1224
00:36:46,000 --> 00:36:47,760
deselected pretty much every other one

1225
00:36:47,760 --> 00:36:49,680
so maybe if you're doing like a castle

1226
00:36:49,680 --> 00:36:50,960
wall or something with

1227
00:36:50,960 --> 00:36:54,000
all these little firing holes or if

1228
00:36:54,000 --> 00:36:55,280
you're doing a kitchen floor or

1229
00:36:55,280 --> 00:36:56,079
something like that

1230
00:36:56,079 --> 00:36:58,079
check your deselect will be able to uh

1231
00:36:58,079 --> 00:36:59,599
to do that really quickly

1232
00:36:59,599 --> 00:37:00,640
one more thing when it comes to

1233
00:37:00,640 --> 00:37:02,160
selecting and deselecting things it

1234
00:37:02,160 --> 00:37:04,320
sometimes is a bit tricky to see

1235
00:37:04,320 --> 00:37:06,560
so i want to show you how to hide and

1236
00:37:06,560 --> 00:37:08,880
show things so if i press l to select

1237
00:37:08,880 --> 00:37:09,920
all of these

1238
00:37:09,920 --> 00:37:11,920
leaves here and then i press h on the

1239
00:37:11,920 --> 00:37:13,760
keyboard then it hides those

1240
00:37:13,760 --> 00:37:16,000
but they're still here if i tap out of

1241
00:37:16,000 --> 00:37:17,359
edit mode you can see that it's still in

1242
00:37:17,359 --> 00:37:18,079
the object

1243
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:19,599
but while we're in edit mode here with

1244
00:37:19,599 --> 00:37:21,520
tab they're gone and now you could do

1245
00:37:21,520 --> 00:37:22,000
stuff like

1246
00:37:22,000 --> 00:37:24,000
here you could fix and maybe you wanted

1247
00:37:24,000 --> 00:37:25,520
to tweak this one maybe you wanted to

1248
00:37:25,520 --> 00:37:27,280
rotate this one a little bit or

1249
00:37:27,280 --> 00:37:28,880
say maybe it was a bit too wonky there

1250
00:37:28,880 --> 00:37:30,960
so we fixed that one maybe we wanted to

1251
00:37:30,960 --> 00:37:32,880
extrude it a little bit more there

1252
00:37:32,880 --> 00:37:35,119
do some final tweaks and now to bring

1253
00:37:35,119 --> 00:37:36,800
the geometry back that's hidden you do

1254
00:37:36,800 --> 00:37:37,200
alt

1255
00:37:37,200 --> 00:37:40,000
h and that brings it back you can also

1256
00:37:40,000 --> 00:37:40,720
do this for

1257
00:37:40,720 --> 00:37:42,480
certain faces let's say you only wanted

1258
00:37:42,480 --> 00:37:44,079
to hide these faces here so i hold the

1259
00:37:44,079 --> 00:37:44,880
shift key

1260
00:37:44,880 --> 00:37:46,720
and then i press h to hide that because

1261
00:37:46,720 --> 00:37:48,240
sometimes you want to be able to see

1262
00:37:48,240 --> 00:37:50,400
stuff especially if you in old z with

1263
00:37:50,400 --> 00:37:52,320
x-ray here sometimes you want to hide

1264
00:37:52,320 --> 00:37:54,400
some geometry and then you can always

1265
00:37:54,400 --> 00:37:55,520
bring it back with alt

1266
00:37:55,520 --> 00:37:58,079
h when you're done i do this very much

1267
00:37:58,079 --> 00:37:59,839
if i model cars for example and i want

1268
00:37:59,839 --> 00:38:00,480
to

1269
00:38:00,480 --> 00:38:01,839
hide a bunch of cars that are in the

1270
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:04,079
same object i just hide them

1271
00:38:04,079 --> 00:38:06,320
h key out of sight out of mind and then

1272
00:38:06,320 --> 00:38:09,680
i bring it back with alt h again

1273
00:38:11,040 --> 00:38:12,320
okay now we're going to go into some

1274
00:38:12,320 --> 00:38:14,320
more mesh editing details here this is

1275
00:38:14,320 --> 00:38:15,200
fun stuff so

1276
00:38:15,200 --> 00:38:16,880
don't snooze off on me now let's hide

1277
00:38:16,880 --> 00:38:18,960
this tree i press h to hide the whole

1278
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:20,160
object this time

1279
00:38:20,160 --> 00:38:21,920
let's add a new one we want to bring

1280
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:24,400
this 3d cursor back so shift

1281
00:38:24,400 --> 00:38:26,560
c to bring it back into the center here

1282
00:38:26,560 --> 00:38:28,079
let's revisit that crate that we did

1283
00:38:28,079 --> 00:38:28,560
before

1284
00:38:28,560 --> 00:38:31,680
so we do shift a we add a cube and

1285
00:38:31,680 --> 00:38:32,000
remember

1286
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:34,640
we added a new object now let's double

1287
00:38:34,640 --> 00:38:35,680
click on it and name it

1288
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,680
create this time since it's a new object

1289
00:38:37,680 --> 00:38:39,200
here i could have to go back to the

1290
00:38:39,200 --> 00:38:41,680
shading tab while it's selected

1291
00:38:41,680 --> 00:38:43,200
click this little drop down here and

1292
00:38:43,200 --> 00:38:45,200
select the material again and here's our

1293
00:38:45,200 --> 00:38:46,000
colors back

1294
00:38:46,000 --> 00:38:48,320
remember we do on the left side here a

1295
00:38:48,320 --> 00:38:49,119
scale

1296
00:38:49,119 --> 00:38:52,160
0 and then g to move the colors

1297
00:38:52,160 --> 00:38:54,400
back here and we're going to repeat what

1298
00:38:54,400 --> 00:38:56,079
we did before now i'm going to do

1299
00:38:56,079 --> 00:38:58,720
i to inset and remember we still have

1300
00:38:58,720 --> 00:38:59,760
individual on

1301
00:38:59,760 --> 00:39:01,280
if it looks like this for you just press

1302
00:39:01,280 --> 00:39:03,119
i again and then alt e

1303
00:39:03,119 --> 00:39:05,040
to bring these faces in here let's say

1304
00:39:05,040 --> 00:39:06,960
we wanted to create some planks now here

1305
00:39:06,960 --> 00:39:10,079
we can do control r to do a loop cut and

1306
00:39:10,079 --> 00:39:11,440
we can use the scroll wheel

1307
00:39:11,440 --> 00:39:13,359
to scroll up and down the number of loop

1308
00:39:13,359 --> 00:39:14,480
cuts we should have

1309
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,920
and when i press the left mouse button

1310
00:39:15,920 --> 00:39:17,680
now it also offers us to place it

1311
00:39:17,680 --> 00:39:18,320
somewhere

1312
00:39:18,320 --> 00:39:19,839
but i want it to be in the center now so

1313
00:39:19,839 --> 00:39:21,839
i just right click and it'll snap it

1314
00:39:21,839 --> 00:39:22,800
back into center

1315
00:39:22,800 --> 00:39:24,400
and just like that we've created a bunch

1316
00:39:24,400 --> 00:39:26,400
of loop cuts and it's extremely useful

1317
00:39:26,400 --> 00:39:27,359
to do loop cuts

1318
00:39:27,359 --> 00:39:29,440
i do it all the time if you wanted to

1319
00:39:29,440 --> 00:39:31,359
not have these to be wonky like this

1320
00:39:31,359 --> 00:39:33,599
you could hold the alt key and remember

1321
00:39:33,599 --> 00:39:35,680
we learned how to select all the way

1322
00:39:35,680 --> 00:39:37,520
around like this like a loop

1323
00:39:37,520 --> 00:39:39,599
and then we learned how to press s to

1324
00:39:39,599 --> 00:39:40,720
scale

1325
00:39:40,720 --> 00:39:42,160
but we don't want to shrink it like this

1326
00:39:42,160 --> 00:39:43,760
but we also learned that we can press

1327
00:39:43,760 --> 00:39:47,359
z on the keyboard to only scale it in

1328
00:39:47,359 --> 00:39:48,560
one direction and we also

1329
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:51,760
know that we can type in zero and so

1330
00:39:51,760 --> 00:39:53,440
just like that we've actually flattened

1331
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,520
this whole thing if we wanted to do that

1332
00:39:55,520 --> 00:39:56,160
for all of them

1333
00:39:56,160 --> 00:40:00,960
just hold the alt key select scale zero

1334
00:40:00,960 --> 00:40:02,560
we can probably do it for these at the

1335
00:40:02,560 --> 00:40:04,480
same time if i do alt here and then i

1336
00:40:04,480 --> 00:40:06,079
have to hold the shift key and alt to

1337
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:07,200
select this one as well

1338
00:40:07,200 --> 00:40:09,599
but now if i press scale z and now

1339
00:40:09,599 --> 00:40:11,599
because we have individual origin here

1340
00:40:11,599 --> 00:40:13,119
on on period selected

1341
00:40:13,119 --> 00:40:16,640
now when we do scale z 0 we flattened

1342
00:40:16,640 --> 00:40:18,240
those as well

1343
00:40:18,240 --> 00:40:20,160
if i'll just control that out of that

1344
00:40:20,160 --> 00:40:21,520
one and i'll do period

1345
00:40:21,520 --> 00:40:23,200
if you're on medium point and you press

1346
00:40:23,200 --> 00:40:25,440
s to scale z and then zero

1347
00:40:25,440 --> 00:40:26,960
it actually brings it into the center

1348
00:40:26,960 --> 00:40:28,480
like this so

1349
00:40:28,480 --> 00:40:29,839
what you want to do these if you want to

1350
00:40:29,839 --> 00:40:31,839
flatten them is that you want to be in

1351
00:40:31,839 --> 00:40:34,640
individual origins here on period scale

1352
00:40:34,640 --> 00:40:35,280
set

1353
00:40:35,280 --> 00:40:37,200
zero and now we've flattened those okay

1354
00:40:37,200 --> 00:40:38,800
what more did we learn we learned that

1355
00:40:38,800 --> 00:40:40,160
we can select uh

1356
00:40:40,160 --> 00:40:42,160
we can press three on the keyboard to

1357
00:40:42,160 --> 00:40:43,839
get this face select and we can hold the

1358
00:40:43,839 --> 00:40:45,520
shift key and select multiple faces and

1359
00:40:45,520 --> 00:40:47,040
we can extrude these in

1360
00:40:47,040 --> 00:40:49,119
and i can select two more here e to

1361
00:40:49,119 --> 00:40:50,240
extrude those in

1362
00:40:50,240 --> 00:40:52,319
and we'll select two more here as well

1363
00:40:52,319 --> 00:40:53,920
and we can actually do this at the same

1364
00:40:53,920 --> 00:40:55,920
time so select those and do alt t

1365
00:40:55,920 --> 00:40:57,839
extrude long phase normals got a few

1366
00:40:57,839 --> 00:40:59,520
more planks there so now we've started

1367
00:40:59,520 --> 00:41:00,319
to create some

1368
00:41:00,319 --> 00:41:02,960
low poly planks in our objects let's add

1369
00:41:02,960 --> 00:41:04,800
some loop cuffs here as well ctrl r

1370
00:41:04,800 --> 00:41:07,280
scroll it up with a wheel maybe to same

1371
00:41:07,280 --> 00:41:08,160
amount of planks

1372
00:41:08,160 --> 00:41:09,920
right click to snap them back i've got

1373
00:41:09,920 --> 00:41:12,000
individual origins here on period

1374
00:41:12,000 --> 00:41:14,079
set so i can do scale but this time

1375
00:41:14,079 --> 00:41:16,000
we're going to scale it on the x-axis

1376
00:41:16,000 --> 00:41:17,920
the red one and then zero and that

1377
00:41:17,920 --> 00:41:20,160
flattened all of those as well

1378
00:41:20,160 --> 00:41:21,920
and i press three on the keyboard to go

1379
00:41:21,920 --> 00:41:23,599
into face select and i select a whole

1380
00:41:23,599 --> 00:41:25,200
bunch of these planks here on the top

1381
00:41:25,200 --> 00:41:25,839
and the bottom

1382
00:41:25,839 --> 00:41:28,800
like this alt e extrude long face

1383
00:41:28,800 --> 00:41:30,160
normals

1384
00:41:30,160 --> 00:41:32,079
and now we've created some more planks

1385
00:41:32,079 --> 00:41:33,520
that brings us to another one that's

1386
00:41:33,520 --> 00:41:34,160
quite useful

1387
00:41:34,160 --> 00:41:36,800
and that's k which is the knife tool it

1388
00:41:36,800 --> 00:41:38,319
doesn't matter if it's like this as well

1389
00:41:38,319 --> 00:41:40,079
see that this one i didn't extrude that

1390
00:41:40,079 --> 00:41:41,599
one you can extrude that one manually a

1391
00:41:41,599 --> 00:41:43,200
little bit like this if you wanted to

1392
00:41:43,200 --> 00:41:45,200
you don't have to be so uniform with

1393
00:41:45,200 --> 00:41:46,640
everything but let's select a few of

1394
00:41:46,640 --> 00:41:48,160
these as well hold the shift key

1395
00:41:48,160 --> 00:41:50,079
e to extrude that one in so let's bring

1396
00:41:50,079 --> 00:41:51,599
out the knife tool we press

1397
00:41:51,599 --> 00:41:53,599
k on the keyboard get this little green

1398
00:41:53,599 --> 00:41:55,280
dot and a knife and then we can start

1399
00:41:55,280 --> 00:41:56,319
slicing stuff

1400
00:41:56,319 --> 00:41:59,119
so let's just click here on the edges

1401
00:41:59,119 --> 00:42:00,480
and let's create something that is

1402
00:42:00,480 --> 00:42:03,119
shaped a little bit like

1403
00:42:03,119 --> 00:42:05,760
the texture of wood so k here we can

1404
00:42:05,760 --> 00:42:07,599
even begin in the center here

1405
00:42:07,599 --> 00:42:09,839
go here there let's make some

1406
00:42:09,839 --> 00:42:11,839
interesting shape here

1407
00:42:11,839 --> 00:42:13,680
maybe like this we can do like another

1408
00:42:13,680 --> 00:42:15,440
loop down there to there

1409
00:42:15,440 --> 00:42:18,319
to there and then k let's do one here as

1410
00:42:18,319 --> 00:42:19,920
well we can even begin in the center of

1411
00:42:19,920 --> 00:42:21,520
the face here and just slice it like

1412
00:42:21,520 --> 00:42:23,200
this

1413
00:42:23,200 --> 00:42:25,599
and see that it added two lines here

1414
00:42:25,599 --> 00:42:27,520
because it can't exist a phase within a

1415
00:42:27,520 --> 00:42:29,119
phase without connecting edges

1416
00:42:29,119 --> 00:42:30,800
so it actually added these little lines

1417
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:33,119
here for me as well automatically

1418
00:42:33,119 --> 00:42:38,079
okay let's do another one here okay

1419
00:42:38,079 --> 00:42:40,720
here as well

1420
00:42:41,280 --> 00:42:43,680
and now if i go three to get make sure

1421
00:42:43,680 --> 00:42:46,960
i'm in face select i hold the shift key

1422
00:42:46,960 --> 00:42:51,119
and i select these ones that i created

1423
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,280
now on the left side here we're still on

1424
00:42:53,280 --> 00:42:54,720
the same brown but if press g

1425
00:42:54,720 --> 00:42:56,960
now i can move the color of this to

1426
00:42:56,960 --> 00:42:59,440
maybe a darker brown

1427
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,119
and if i tap out of edit mode we've

1428
00:43:01,119 --> 00:43:03,440
started to create some colors for this

1429
00:43:03,440 --> 00:43:05,440
and here's where i mentioned before that

1430
00:43:05,440 --> 00:43:06,880
doing this method could add a lot of

1431
00:43:06,880 --> 00:43:08,319
geometry or it will add a lot of

1432
00:43:08,319 --> 00:43:09,680
geometry to your meshes so you have to

1433
00:43:09,680 --> 00:43:12,319
be aware if it becomes too many polygons

1434
00:43:12,319 --> 00:43:14,160
maybe it'll affect your performance in

1435
00:43:14,160 --> 00:43:15,839
that case it could be better to

1436
00:43:15,839 --> 00:43:18,400
to do a texture map but again i like to

1437
00:43:18,400 --> 00:43:19,599
keep this crisp look

1438
00:43:19,599 --> 00:43:22,400
and for my purposes often it doesn't add

1439
00:43:22,400 --> 00:43:24,160
so many polygons that becomes a problem

1440
00:43:24,160 --> 00:43:24,560
because

1441
00:43:24,560 --> 00:43:26,480
pcs especially they're used to handling

1442
00:43:26,480 --> 00:43:27,760
millions of polygons

1443
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,599
so these extra few aren't going to be a

1444
00:43:29,599 --> 00:43:31,520
problem if we reselect these now

1445
00:43:31,520 --> 00:43:33,839
you can even do an extrusion here to get

1446
00:43:33,839 --> 00:43:37,040
this even more detailed

1447
00:43:38,000 --> 00:43:39,520
so let's select those again and press

1448
00:43:39,520 --> 00:43:41,680
just b to extrude them in a little bit

1449
00:43:41,680 --> 00:43:43,839
and that added some texture and tab out

1450
00:43:43,839 --> 00:43:45,520
and this is what it suddenly looks like

1451
00:43:45,520 --> 00:43:46,720
you can also do someone that are

1452
00:43:46,720 --> 00:43:50,400
brighter so if i press k here

1453
00:43:50,800 --> 00:43:52,480
slice a little bit there maybe something

1454
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:55,839
here as well

1455
00:43:56,240 --> 00:43:59,040
three to select the faces here and then

1456
00:43:59,040 --> 00:43:59,359
g

1457
00:43:59,359 --> 00:44:00,800
and let's move it to a brighter one and

1458
00:44:00,800 --> 00:44:03,040
let's move those out so e to extrude out

1459
00:44:03,040 --> 00:44:04,560
a little bit

1460
00:44:04,560 --> 00:44:06,240
tab out of object mode there so we can

1461
00:44:06,240 --> 00:44:07,440
see it there's something called the

1462
00:44:07,440 --> 00:44:08,160
topology

1463
00:44:08,160 --> 00:44:10,480
of meshes as well and this is breaking a

1464
00:44:10,480 --> 00:44:11,520
few of the rules

1465
00:44:11,520 --> 00:44:12,960
and i'll probably get some a few

1466
00:44:12,960 --> 00:44:14,800
comments about this because

1467
00:44:14,800 --> 00:44:16,319
when you're modeling characters and

1468
00:44:16,319 --> 00:44:18,000
things like that you should really avoid

1469
00:44:18,000 --> 00:44:19,280
to do what i just did here

1470
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:22,240
with creating basically meshes that are

1471
00:44:22,240 --> 00:44:23,760
have vertices that are in the middle of

1472
00:44:23,760 --> 00:44:24,800
a face here

1473
00:44:24,800 --> 00:44:26,640
because especially if you animate

1474
00:44:26,640 --> 00:44:28,160
objects like a body or something like

1475
00:44:28,160 --> 00:44:29,599
that where you're bending limbs

1476
00:44:29,599 --> 00:44:31,440
it'll look really weird if i were to

1477
00:44:31,440 --> 00:44:33,280
move this vertex out now you can see

1478
00:44:33,280 --> 00:44:35,440
that it looks totally broken

1479
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:37,200
so that's something you have to be aware

1480
00:44:37,200 --> 00:44:38,800
of but i don't want to rule out this

1481
00:44:38,800 --> 00:44:40,560
method to do stuff because it's really

1482
00:44:40,560 --> 00:44:41,599
useful if you have

1483
00:44:41,599 --> 00:44:43,599
static objects like a crate for example

1484
00:44:43,599 --> 00:44:46,000
or like a stone or whatever it is

1485
00:44:46,000 --> 00:44:47,599
then it's not really a problem i'd say

1486
00:44:47,599 --> 00:44:49,440
you could use it i use it all the time

1487
00:44:49,440 --> 00:44:51,119
so if i wanted to add some character to

1488
00:44:51,119 --> 00:44:52,400
this box now we could

1489
00:44:52,400 --> 00:44:54,960
select the face here and then press g to

1490
00:44:54,960 --> 00:44:55,920
move it

1491
00:44:55,920 --> 00:44:58,560
or o to enable proportional editing g to

1492
00:44:58,560 --> 00:44:59,200
move it

1493
00:44:59,200 --> 00:45:01,119
scroll the scroll wheel down and then we

1494
00:45:01,119 --> 00:45:03,440
can start making some

1495
00:45:03,440 --> 00:45:04,960
some shapes to this object we haven't

1496
00:45:04,960 --> 00:45:06,480
colorized this part here but let's move

1497
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:07,359
that one down

1498
00:45:07,359 --> 00:45:08,800
just be aware though that when you've

1499
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,880
used this method to colorize object or

1500
00:45:10,880 --> 00:45:12,560
make some details then you have to be

1501
00:45:12,560 --> 00:45:14,079
really careful with the proportional

1502
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,839
editing because it could really easily

1503
00:45:15,839 --> 00:45:17,200
break here if i press

1504
00:45:17,200 --> 00:45:18,800
if i have proportional editing enabled

1505
00:45:18,800 --> 00:45:20,480
there i press g to move it

1506
00:45:20,480 --> 00:45:22,240
you can see that we run into problems so

1507
00:45:22,240 --> 00:45:23,520
that's something you that you need to be

1508
00:45:23,520 --> 00:45:25,119
aware of the knife tool as i mentioned

1509
00:45:25,119 --> 00:45:26,720
as well it's got a few more tricks up

1510
00:45:26,720 --> 00:45:27,359
its sleeve

1511
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,200
and if i tab into edit mode again i

1512
00:45:29,200 --> 00:45:31,200
press k to go to the knife tool

1513
00:45:31,200 --> 00:45:32,560
sometimes you want to make sure that

1514
00:45:32,560 --> 00:45:34,079
you're in the center here and you can

1515
00:45:34,079 --> 00:45:36,160
just hold the ctrl key and it'll snap

1516
00:45:36,160 --> 00:45:37,920
you to the center so then you know that

1517
00:45:37,920 --> 00:45:39,680
you snap from one edge to the other

1518
00:45:39,680 --> 00:45:40,079
there

1519
00:45:40,079 --> 00:45:42,000
and then press enter so that's a good

1520
00:45:42,000 --> 00:45:43,440
thing about the knife tool

1521
00:45:43,440 --> 00:45:45,520
another one is the the angle constraint

1522
00:45:45,520 --> 00:45:47,599
so if i press k on the knife tool

1523
00:45:47,599 --> 00:45:50,640
i press there and then i press c then i

1524
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,240
can angle constraint it to

1525
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:56,240
an axis here which could also be useful

1526
00:45:56,400 --> 00:45:58,240
okay that was our crate let's hide that

1527
00:45:58,240 --> 00:45:59,599
one for a second and

1528
00:45:59,599 --> 00:46:01,520
let's do shift a now to create a new

1529
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:02,640
mesh a cube

1530
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:04,560
and let's bring the shading here we need

1531
00:46:04,560 --> 00:46:06,079
to switch the material back here as we

1532
00:46:06,079 --> 00:46:06,800
did before

1533
00:46:06,800 --> 00:46:09,520
go back here a on the left side scale

1534
00:46:09,520 --> 00:46:10,480
zero

1535
00:46:10,480 --> 00:46:13,280
enter g to move it to gray let's make a

1536
00:46:13,280 --> 00:46:14,240
stone this time

1537
00:46:14,240 --> 00:46:15,520
now we're going to do something called

1538
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,599
subdivision surface if i have this

1539
00:46:17,599 --> 00:46:20,240
object selected now i have to be out of

1540
00:46:20,240 --> 00:46:21,760
not in this edit mode but out here in

1541
00:46:21,760 --> 00:46:22,880
the object mode

1542
00:46:22,880 --> 00:46:25,839
and then i can press ctrl between 1 and

1543
00:46:25,839 --> 00:46:26,319
5.

1544
00:46:26,319 --> 00:46:29,040
if i press ctrl 2 here it applies a

1545
00:46:29,040 --> 00:46:31,680
modifier called the subdivision modifier

1546
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,160
and basically that just takes an object

1547
00:46:34,160 --> 00:46:36,000
and adds geometry and smooths out the

1548
00:46:36,000 --> 00:46:37,680
edges so this cube nearly became a

1549
00:46:37,680 --> 00:46:39,440
perfect sphere now suddenly if i were to

1550
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:40,079
press ctrl

1551
00:46:40,079 --> 00:46:41,839
1 instead it would have been the same as

1552
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:43,119
having one level here

1553
00:46:43,119 --> 00:46:44,880
and if i were to press ctrl 3 it would

1554
00:46:44,880 --> 00:46:46,880
have or 4 it would have added a lot more

1555
00:46:46,880 --> 00:46:47,599
detail here

1556
00:46:47,599 --> 00:46:49,440
if i wanted to make a stone here let's

1557
00:46:49,440 --> 00:46:50,800
go back here and press ctrl

1558
00:46:50,800 --> 00:46:52,880
2. i have to enable my screencast keys

1559
00:46:52,880 --> 00:46:54,800
again so you can see and now let's apply

1560
00:46:54,800 --> 00:46:56,160
this modifier it's in this

1561
00:46:56,160 --> 00:46:57,920
wrench tool thing here we apply this

1562
00:46:57,920 --> 00:46:59,520
modifier because otherwise

1563
00:46:59,520 --> 00:47:01,280
this is actually still a cube here but

1564
00:47:01,280 --> 00:47:03,760
this modifier when it's enabled shows it

1565
00:47:03,760 --> 00:47:05,359
the way the result should be but we want

1566
00:47:05,359 --> 00:47:06,960
to actually apply this one all together

1567
00:47:06,960 --> 00:47:07,920
now and now it's

1568
00:47:07,920 --> 00:47:09,839
applied this modifier and transform this

1569
00:47:09,839 --> 00:47:11,280
so this is actually a

1570
00:47:11,280 --> 00:47:13,119
instead of a cube now it's a subdivided

1571
00:47:13,119 --> 00:47:14,800
cube that rounded it off like this

1572
00:47:14,800 --> 00:47:16,640
subdivision is really useful you can use

1573
00:47:16,640 --> 00:47:18,319
it when you make characters you can make

1574
00:47:18,319 --> 00:47:19,040
them

1575
00:47:19,040 --> 00:47:21,280
from blocky to really round and smooth

1576
00:47:21,280 --> 00:47:22,079
and if i

1577
00:47:22,079 --> 00:47:23,760
uh let's say we wanted to model a stone

1578
00:47:23,760 --> 00:47:25,920
here now in fact let's control z

1579
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,160
and even apply more of a modifier here

1580
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,680
let's go back all the way to the cube

1581
00:47:29,680 --> 00:47:30,079
here

1582
00:47:30,079 --> 00:47:32,079
control four let's make it really

1583
00:47:32,079 --> 00:47:33,839
detailed like this and then apply this

1584
00:47:33,839 --> 00:47:34,720
one

1585
00:47:34,720 --> 00:47:37,839
tab into edit mode one into vertex mode

1586
00:47:37,839 --> 00:47:39,440
and then we have proportional editing

1587
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:40,319
very important here

1588
00:47:40,319 --> 00:47:43,440
remember the o key and then g to move it

1589
00:47:43,440 --> 00:47:45,920
and now we can start squashing the stone

1590
00:47:45,920 --> 00:47:47,599
so g to move let's just take some

1591
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:49,040
different maybe we want it flat at the

1592
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:50,079
bottom so i pick a

1593
00:47:50,079 --> 00:47:52,720
vertex down here g to move it up scroll

1594
00:47:52,720 --> 00:47:54,559
wheel to round it off

1595
00:47:54,559 --> 00:47:56,559
and this is not so low poly anymore as

1596
00:47:56,559 --> 00:47:58,079
you can see but that's okay we're going

1597
00:47:58,079 --> 00:48:00,000
to make it back into low poly

1598
00:48:00,000 --> 00:48:02,000
so let's just use the scroll wheel and

1599
00:48:02,000 --> 00:48:03,520
proportional editing to get some

1600
00:48:03,520 --> 00:48:05,040
interesting shapes to the stone here

1601
00:48:05,040 --> 00:48:07,839
like this maybe

1602
00:48:09,920 --> 00:48:13,040
there and maybe some more shapes like

1603
00:48:13,040 --> 00:48:14,000
that

1604
00:48:14,000 --> 00:48:15,280
now we've got something but we still

1605
00:48:15,280 --> 00:48:17,119
want to bring it down now again so that

1606
00:48:17,119 --> 00:48:17,680
brings us

1607
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,760
in another modifier and that's we can

1608
00:48:19,760 --> 00:48:20,880
apply this one called

1609
00:48:20,880 --> 00:48:22,559
decimate that we just did for the box

1610
00:48:22,559 --> 00:48:24,079
before as well so we

1611
00:48:24,079 --> 00:48:25,839
click on decimate and we have to be in

1612
00:48:25,839 --> 00:48:28,079
object mode now so not in edit mode

1613
00:48:28,079 --> 00:48:29,760
and then i bring this ratio down on the

1614
00:48:29,760 --> 00:48:32,079
slider you could also type in something

1615
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,079
but now we've decimated geometry down

1616
00:48:34,079 --> 00:48:36,400
back into low poly so the combination of

1617
00:48:36,400 --> 00:48:38,800
subdividing objects adding details so

1618
00:48:38,800 --> 00:48:40,480
you can reshape them and then using

1619
00:48:40,480 --> 00:48:41,119
decimate

1620
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:43,040
to decimate them again can really get

1621
00:48:43,040 --> 00:48:44,800
some interesting low poly results for

1622
00:48:44,800 --> 00:48:46,400
you so keep that in mind

1623
00:48:46,400 --> 00:48:49,440
subdivide modify and then decimate

1624
00:48:49,440 --> 00:48:51,040
working on this rock now as well we can

1625
00:48:51,040 --> 00:48:52,960
turn it into more of a stylistic rock

1626
00:48:52,960 --> 00:48:54,480
here as well with something called

1627
00:48:54,480 --> 00:48:56,960
flatten if i tab into edit mode i press

1628
00:48:56,960 --> 00:48:58,079
three to go into face

1629
00:48:58,079 --> 00:48:59,920
select we could use anything here but

1630
00:48:59,920 --> 00:49:02,079
let's do c to circle select a few faces

1631
00:49:02,079 --> 00:49:02,480
here

1632
00:49:02,480 --> 00:49:06,240
like that press enter now i can press

1633
00:49:06,240 --> 00:49:10,400
f3 here and type in flatten

1634
00:49:10,559 --> 00:49:13,599
and suddenly it's turned this into a

1635
00:49:13,599 --> 00:49:15,359
flat surface let's do that a few times

1636
00:49:15,359 --> 00:49:16,079
so i do

1637
00:49:16,079 --> 00:49:19,599
seat circle select maybe those ones

1638
00:49:19,599 --> 00:49:22,240
enter f3 and we've already typed flat in

1639
00:49:22,240 --> 00:49:24,240
there so i press enter

1640
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:26,079
c to circle select or first we want to

1641
00:49:26,079 --> 00:49:28,079
actually press escape and double click a

1642
00:49:28,079 --> 00:49:29,359
to deselect

1643
00:49:29,359 --> 00:49:32,640
c to circle select a few of these

1644
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:35,920
f3 flatten and here becomes a bit of a

1645
00:49:35,920 --> 00:49:37,760
problem maybe so we could think about

1646
00:49:37,760 --> 00:49:39,760
ways to fix that but let's do a few more

1647
00:49:39,760 --> 00:49:41,680
things first let's do flatten this part

1648
00:49:41,680 --> 00:49:42,960
as well

1649
00:49:42,960 --> 00:49:46,880
f3 flatten and maybe here

1650
00:49:46,880 --> 00:49:50,640
enter f3 flatten we learned before that

1651
00:49:50,640 --> 00:49:51,599
we could

1652
00:49:51,599 --> 00:49:55,040
use scaling on on a certain axis

1653
00:49:55,040 --> 00:49:58,880
so for example if i do c to select here

1654
00:49:58,880 --> 00:50:00,960
enter if i were to scale this now it

1655
00:50:00,960 --> 00:50:02,480
just scales it up and down

1656
00:50:02,480 --> 00:50:04,319
and if i were to scale it on an axis

1657
00:50:04,319 --> 00:50:07,040
like z it would flatten it and widen it

1658
00:50:07,040 --> 00:50:09,040
but here we can actually go into press

1659
00:50:09,040 --> 00:50:10,880
comma and here we have a whole new

1660
00:50:10,880 --> 00:50:11,520
selection of

1661
00:50:11,520 --> 00:50:12,880
something called orientation that we

1662
00:50:12,880 --> 00:50:15,119
haven't covered yet and by default it's

1663
00:50:15,119 --> 00:50:16,960
set to global so when i scale on the

1664
00:50:16,960 --> 00:50:17,680
z-axis

1665
00:50:17,680 --> 00:50:20,720
it's the vertical blue z-axis here

1666
00:50:20,720 --> 00:50:23,839
but if we do scale or if i do comma

1667
00:50:23,839 --> 00:50:26,079
and then select normal here remember the

1668
00:50:26,079 --> 00:50:27,200
normal is the

1669
00:50:27,200 --> 00:50:29,599
face the perpendicular angle to a face

1670
00:50:29,599 --> 00:50:30,960
so if you have a flat face like this

1671
00:50:30,960 --> 00:50:32,559
it's 90 degrees

1672
00:50:32,559 --> 00:50:35,359
in the center going up that's the normal

1673
00:50:35,359 --> 00:50:37,839
and when we have multiple faces selected

1674
00:50:37,839 --> 00:50:40,480
it'll be the averaged normal so now when

1675
00:50:40,480 --> 00:50:41,920
i you can see this blue arrow is

1676
00:50:41,920 --> 00:50:42,800
pointing

1677
00:50:42,800 --> 00:50:45,520
away from an average of these normals

1678
00:50:45,520 --> 00:50:46,000
here

1679
00:50:46,000 --> 00:50:48,720
so now when i press s to scale i can do

1680
00:50:48,720 --> 00:50:49,440
z

1681
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,119
to flatten it like this and we've got

1682
00:50:51,119 --> 00:50:52,720
proportional editing on now as well

1683
00:50:52,720 --> 00:50:53,359
which is why

1684
00:50:53,359 --> 00:50:54,960
it's moving the surrounding one if we

1685
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,200
then want that we can deselect that one

1686
00:50:57,200 --> 00:50:58,000
with o

1687
00:50:58,000 --> 00:50:59,839
press s to scale again and then force it

1688
00:50:59,839 --> 00:51:01,040
on the z axis

1689
00:51:01,040 --> 00:51:03,040
and then you can type zero as well and

1690
00:51:03,040 --> 00:51:05,359
that's basically the same as flattening

1691
00:51:05,359 --> 00:51:06,880
but if you don't want to fully flatten

1692
00:51:06,880 --> 00:51:09,040
it you can press s to scale and then

1693
00:51:09,040 --> 00:51:11,599
do z to like bring those faces a little

1694
00:51:11,599 --> 00:51:12,559
bit more

1695
00:51:12,559 --> 00:51:14,960
into the shape that you want sometimes

1696
00:51:14,960 --> 00:51:16,559
you have little squiggly bits like this

1697
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:17,680
that you want to get rid of

1698
00:51:17,680 --> 00:51:19,839
and let's say we wanted to fix this one

1699
00:51:19,839 --> 00:51:21,680
let's say this face is annoying us

1700
00:51:21,680 --> 00:51:23,839
a lot like this face is annoying most

1701
00:51:23,839 --> 00:51:25,119
people probably

1702
00:51:25,119 --> 00:51:28,240
but here i can switch this little thing

1703
00:51:28,240 --> 00:51:29,760
we haven't talked about this one but but

1704
00:51:29,760 --> 00:51:32,160
snap two i can change to vertex if i

1705
00:51:32,160 --> 00:51:34,240
wanted to move this vertex now onto

1706
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,160
exactly the location of that vertex

1707
00:51:36,160 --> 00:51:38,079
i can press g to move it and since we

1708
00:51:38,079 --> 00:51:40,160
had switched to vertex at the top now if

1709
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,599
i hold the ctrl key

1710
00:51:41,599 --> 00:51:43,440
i can actually magically snap it onto

1711
00:51:43,440 --> 00:51:44,720
any other vertex here

1712
00:51:44,720 --> 00:51:46,400
but we have to be careful because when i

1713
00:51:46,400 --> 00:51:47,920
did that now it looked like we fixed

1714
00:51:47,920 --> 00:51:48,480
everything

1715
00:51:48,480 --> 00:51:50,800
but if i press g to move it you can see

1716
00:51:50,800 --> 00:51:52,640
that it's actually two vertices there

1717
00:51:52,640 --> 00:51:54,079
and that's a problem you don't really

1718
00:51:54,079 --> 00:51:55,440
want to have overlapping vertices

1719
00:51:55,440 --> 00:51:56,880
because you have faces there now that

1720
00:51:56,880 --> 00:51:58,720
are basically non-existent but it'll

1721
00:51:58,720 --> 00:52:01,040
cause problems there's two ways to fix

1722
00:52:01,040 --> 00:52:01,920
that

1723
00:52:01,920 --> 00:52:03,520
first one you can do instead i press

1724
00:52:03,520 --> 00:52:05,520
ctrl z and we can enable this little

1725
00:52:05,520 --> 00:52:06,640
thing up here called

1726
00:52:06,640 --> 00:52:08,800
auto merge vertices so if i click on

1727
00:52:08,800 --> 00:52:09,680
that one

1728
00:52:09,680 --> 00:52:12,400
i press g to move it and now if i hold

1729
00:52:12,400 --> 00:52:13,599
the ctrl key

1730
00:52:13,599 --> 00:52:15,760
and i snap it onto there since auto

1731
00:52:15,760 --> 00:52:17,599
merge vertices is on now it'll detect

1732
00:52:17,599 --> 00:52:19,280
that oh these vertices are in the exact

1733
00:52:19,280 --> 00:52:21,040
same location so i'll merge those into

1734
00:52:21,040 --> 00:52:21,920
one

1735
00:52:21,920 --> 00:52:23,680
so now when i press g to move it it's

1736
00:52:23,680 --> 00:52:25,839
already magically fixed that for us

1737
00:52:25,839 --> 00:52:27,440
the other way to do it is if you don't

1738
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:29,040
have auto merge vertices

1739
00:52:29,040 --> 00:52:32,160
you press g to move it hold the ctrl key

1740
00:52:32,160 --> 00:52:35,359
snap it onto that vertex then now

1741
00:52:35,359 --> 00:52:37,839
i can do a to select everything and

1742
00:52:37,839 --> 00:52:39,599
there's a hotkey it's changed now so in

1743
00:52:39,599 --> 00:52:41,119
2.83 it's just the

1744
00:52:41,119 --> 00:52:43,440
m key it used to be different one it

1745
00:52:43,440 --> 00:52:45,040
used to be alt m but now it's

1746
00:52:45,040 --> 00:52:48,559
m and then you do merge by distance and

1747
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:50,400
you can see down there it says removed

1748
00:52:50,400 --> 00:52:53,599
one vertices or one vertex it's because

1749
00:52:53,599 --> 00:52:54,800
it goes through the whole mesh and

1750
00:52:54,800 --> 00:52:56,400
detects if there are duplicates one so

1751
00:52:56,400 --> 00:52:57,680
that's pretty good to do every now and

1752
00:52:57,680 --> 00:52:59,680
then if you've got a complex mesh

1753
00:52:59,680 --> 00:53:02,640
just select all the vertices do m and

1754
00:53:02,640 --> 00:53:04,559
then merge by distance and remove all

1755
00:53:04,559 --> 00:53:06,079
those doubles so you don't run into

1756
00:53:06,079 --> 00:53:07,359
problems with them i don't know if i've

1757
00:53:07,359 --> 00:53:08,800
covered this but i'll give you this one

1758
00:53:08,800 --> 00:53:09,359
as well

1759
00:53:09,359 --> 00:53:11,359
let's say we wanted to create a bit of a

1760
00:53:11,359 --> 00:53:13,520
worn edge to this stone and i press two

1761
00:53:13,520 --> 00:53:15,200
to make sure i'm in the edge select and

1762
00:53:15,200 --> 00:53:16,800
let's hold the shift key now and

1763
00:53:16,800 --> 00:53:18,480
select a few of these edges here and

1764
00:53:18,480 --> 00:53:20,640
then now you can press ctrl

1765
00:53:20,640 --> 00:53:23,280
b to do the bevel again and we've

1766
00:53:23,280 --> 00:53:24,559
actually done this before because i've

1767
00:53:24,559 --> 00:53:26,079
got loads of lines here we don't really

1768
00:53:26,079 --> 00:53:27,599
want that many so let's bring segments

1769
00:53:27,599 --> 00:53:28,079
down to

1770
00:53:28,079 --> 00:53:31,040
one and now when we tab out of object

1771
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:32,640
mode we can see that it's created quite

1772
00:53:32,640 --> 00:53:33,119
a nice

1773
00:53:33,119 --> 00:53:35,040
little beveled edge to this and then if

1774
00:53:35,040 --> 00:53:36,160
we go one

1775
00:53:36,160 --> 00:53:38,160
into vertex edit here we can select a

1776
00:53:38,160 --> 00:53:39,839
few of these vertices and press

1777
00:53:39,839 --> 00:53:42,640
s to scale them and then here maybe we

1778
00:53:42,640 --> 00:53:45,200
want it smaller as to scale it down

1779
00:53:45,200 --> 00:53:47,359
here maybe we want to scale it up again

1780
00:53:47,359 --> 00:53:48,960
you can control

1781
00:53:48,960 --> 00:53:50,720
through scaling here how much you want

1782
00:53:50,720 --> 00:53:53,040
those beveled edges to be on the rock so

1783
00:53:53,040 --> 00:53:53,839
that's quite good

1784
00:53:53,839 --> 00:53:56,079
for stones low polystones okay let's

1785
00:53:56,079 --> 00:53:57,040
double click and

1786
00:53:57,040 --> 00:54:00,160
name this one stone

1787
00:54:00,160 --> 00:54:01,839
sometimes you want to start getting

1788
00:54:01,839 --> 00:54:03,520
nitty gritty with your editing so

1789
00:54:03,520 --> 00:54:05,359
sometimes you want to delete faces let's

1790
00:54:05,359 --> 00:54:07,119
say we wanted to shift select a few of

1791
00:54:07,119 --> 00:54:08,000
these

1792
00:54:08,000 --> 00:54:09,920
and then we wanted to press delete for

1793
00:54:09,920 --> 00:54:11,200
whatever reason

1794
00:54:11,200 --> 00:54:13,520
then it's a big hole here that could be

1795
00:54:13,520 --> 00:54:14,880
a bit scary in the first time that

1796
00:54:14,880 --> 00:54:15,359
happens

1797
00:54:15,359 --> 00:54:17,119
but don't be too worried about it you

1798
00:54:17,119 --> 00:54:18,800
can actually fix holes like this

1799
00:54:18,800 --> 00:54:21,200
by if you have a hole in your mesh in

1800
00:54:21,200 --> 00:54:21,839
edit mode

1801
00:54:21,839 --> 00:54:24,319
click a for everything and press f on

1802
00:54:24,319 --> 00:54:25,200
the keyboard

1803
00:54:25,200 --> 00:54:27,280
that fills this hole automatically but

1804
00:54:27,280 --> 00:54:29,440
it creates one big mesh like this

1805
00:54:29,440 --> 00:54:31,359
so sometimes you can get into some

1806
00:54:31,359 --> 00:54:33,119
alignment issues let's say we had these

1807
00:54:33,119 --> 00:54:34,880
gone

1808
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:37,040
over the edge here like that let's

1809
00:54:37,040 --> 00:54:38,559
select those press delete

1810
00:54:38,559 --> 00:54:40,960
faces select everything and press f you

1811
00:54:40,960 --> 00:54:42,799
can see that it fixes the hole

1812
00:54:42,799 --> 00:54:44,640
but it's got some weird stuff going on

1813
00:54:44,640 --> 00:54:45,920
here with the shading

1814
00:54:45,920 --> 00:54:48,160
and that's because it's created one face

1815
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:50,319
so it's really finding it difficult here

1816
00:54:50,319 --> 00:54:51,599
but there's a way to fix it

1817
00:54:51,599 --> 00:54:52,960
either we can do it manually by

1818
00:54:52,960 --> 00:54:54,720
selecting we know that we want the line

1819
00:54:54,720 --> 00:54:57,040
between that vertex and that vertex and

1820
00:54:57,040 --> 00:54:57,839
then we can press

1821
00:54:57,839 --> 00:55:00,480
j and that fixes pretty much everything

1822
00:55:00,480 --> 00:55:02,160
there because then you tell

1823
00:55:02,160 --> 00:55:04,720
the mesh that i want a distinct edge

1824
00:55:04,720 --> 00:55:06,000
here so that's fixed

1825
00:55:06,000 --> 00:55:08,400
another thing you could do is if we

1826
00:55:08,400 --> 00:55:10,640
control z out of that one

1827
00:55:10,640 --> 00:55:12,559
you could select that face and press

1828
00:55:12,559 --> 00:55:13,680
ctrl t

1829
00:55:13,680 --> 00:55:15,520
to triangulate it that's another way to

1830
00:55:15,520 --> 00:55:17,680
fix that one also if you want to say

1831
00:55:17,680 --> 00:55:19,440
exactly how faces should be created

1832
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:20,000
actually let's

1833
00:55:20,000 --> 00:55:21,680
do ctrl t to triangulate that one as

1834
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:23,440
well let's say we had this one deleted

1835
00:55:23,440 --> 00:55:24,400
again like this

1836
00:55:24,400 --> 00:55:26,880
delete faces if you want to have control

1837
00:55:26,880 --> 00:55:28,640
while you create this instead of marking

1838
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:29,920
everything you can press

1839
00:55:29,920 --> 00:55:32,000
2 to select the edges here and let's say

1840
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:32,960
i want to select this

1841
00:55:32,960 --> 00:55:35,200
edge that edge and that edge and now

1842
00:55:35,200 --> 00:55:36,079
when i press f

1843
00:55:36,079 --> 00:55:38,240
it'll create a face between those lines

1844
00:55:38,240 --> 00:55:39,119
that i set

1845
00:55:39,119 --> 00:55:40,880
here same thing here if i wanted to

1846
00:55:40,880 --> 00:55:42,960
control i could select

1847
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,079
exactly which lines and f to create them

1848
00:55:46,079 --> 00:55:47,760
sometimes you'll run into a problem here

1849
00:55:47,760 --> 00:55:49,520
where the face is created maybe

1850
00:55:49,520 --> 00:55:51,440
inwards i'll just flip it manually now

1851
00:55:51,440 --> 00:55:53,680
so you can see what i mean

1852
00:55:53,680 --> 00:55:56,240
flip normals so this face actually

1853
00:55:56,240 --> 00:55:57,680
exists here if we do old said

1854
00:55:57,680 --> 00:55:59,040
you can see that there's like a center

1855
00:55:59,040 --> 00:56:01,200
point here you can see it

1856
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:04,720
that one an old set again to

1857
00:56:04,720 --> 00:56:06,880
disable x-ray so there is a face here

1858
00:56:06,880 --> 00:56:08,559
but remember that we have the back face

1859
00:56:08,559 --> 00:56:09,359
culling on

1860
00:56:09,359 --> 00:56:11,200
so if if we can see the back face it

1861
00:56:11,200 --> 00:56:12,880
looks like there's a face there

1862
00:56:12,880 --> 00:56:14,960
but if we enable backface culling this

1863
00:56:14,960 --> 00:56:16,720
is what most game edges would see

1864
00:56:16,720 --> 00:56:19,920
a big gaping hole here sounded weird

1865
00:56:19,920 --> 00:56:23,599
okay but we can fix that in a few ways

1866
00:56:23,599 --> 00:56:25,200
one of them is manually by selecting

1867
00:56:25,200 --> 00:56:26,880
this face that we know exists there

1868
00:56:26,880 --> 00:56:29,280
pressing f3 and typing flip normals so

1869
00:56:29,280 --> 00:56:30,799
that was one way to do it

1870
00:56:30,799 --> 00:56:32,400
the other way to do it is that you can

1871
00:56:32,400 --> 00:56:34,640
actually recalculate the normals for the

1872
00:56:34,640 --> 00:56:36,240
whole mesh so let's say we flipped

1873
00:56:36,240 --> 00:56:38,079
we let's say we have a few of them let's

1874
00:56:38,079 --> 00:56:41,280
flip like this i'll select a few bunch

1875
00:56:41,280 --> 00:56:43,040
flip normals if you don't want to select

1876
00:56:43,040 --> 00:56:44,720
all these manually and flip them you can

1877
00:56:44,720 --> 00:56:46,160
do a to select everything

1878
00:56:46,160 --> 00:56:49,200
and then press alt n and then

1879
00:56:49,200 --> 00:56:52,240
recalculate outside and now blender will

1880
00:56:52,240 --> 00:56:53,920
sort of detect which ones are facing

1881
00:56:53,920 --> 00:56:55,680
outside and try to fix it for you so

1882
00:56:55,680 --> 00:56:56,240
that

1883
00:56:56,240 --> 00:56:58,079
works quite often not all the time but

1884
00:56:58,079 --> 00:56:59,599
quite often and equally

1885
00:56:59,599 --> 00:57:01,920
there's this thing called alt n and you

1886
00:57:01,920 --> 00:57:04,160
could do recalculate inside

1887
00:57:04,160 --> 00:57:06,960
so if you made a cave for example then

1888
00:57:06,960 --> 00:57:08,480
you can certainly be inside of it but

1889
00:57:08,480 --> 00:57:09,440
let's flip them back

1890
00:57:09,440 --> 00:57:12,720
alt n recalculate outside

1891
00:57:12,720 --> 00:57:14,720
and back to our stone here you can also

1892
00:57:14,720 --> 00:57:16,400
remove individual edges here

1893
00:57:16,400 --> 00:57:18,559
so if i press two to edge select and

1894
00:57:18,559 --> 00:57:20,079
let's say we wanted to

1895
00:57:20,079 --> 00:57:22,079
it's called dissolve so if i wanted to

1896
00:57:22,079 --> 00:57:24,000
remove these edges here but not

1897
00:57:24,000 --> 00:57:26,880
delete them i can press x or delete and

1898
00:57:26,880 --> 00:57:28,160
then dissolve edges

1899
00:57:28,160 --> 00:57:29,520
and sometimes you want to do this as

1900
00:57:29,520 --> 00:57:31,440
well because sometimes you don't

1901
00:57:31,440 --> 00:57:32,640
let's say you have a bit of a

1902
00:57:32,640 --> 00:57:35,119
triangulation going on like this

1903
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,680
which might be just this like this

1904
00:57:37,680 --> 00:57:39,040
sometimes you want to select all of

1905
00:57:39,040 --> 00:57:40,000
these

1906
00:57:40,000 --> 00:57:43,119
like that press x and dissolve edges

1907
00:57:43,119 --> 00:57:44,640
and that will dissolve those and just

1908
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:46,799
create one face but be aware that when

1909
00:57:46,799 --> 00:57:48,640
you subdivide and things like that okay

1910
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:49,760
another thing we can do is

1911
00:57:49,760 --> 00:57:51,520
something called bridge edge loops which

1912
00:57:51,520 --> 00:57:52,960
could be quite useful

1913
00:57:52,960 --> 00:57:55,280
let's hide this one the stone and let's

1914
00:57:55,280 --> 00:57:56,160
bring a new one

1915
00:57:56,160 --> 00:57:59,359
shift a create a new cube

1916
00:57:59,359 --> 00:58:01,280
tab into edit mode first we'll switch

1917
00:58:01,280 --> 00:58:02,720
the shading again back to

1918
00:58:02,720 --> 00:58:06,160
the material here a

1919
00:58:06,160 --> 00:58:09,440
scale 0 on the uvs you know this by now

1920
00:58:09,440 --> 00:58:12,000
g to move it onto gray l to select this

1921
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:12,880
one

1922
00:58:12,880 --> 00:58:14,319
actually let's just create something

1923
00:58:14,319 --> 00:58:16,400
here um let's

1924
00:58:16,400 --> 00:58:17,839
do the old school stuff what we learned

1925
00:58:17,839 --> 00:58:19,520
a long time ago now e takes true d to

1926
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,200
extrude s to scale e to extrude to

1927
00:58:21,200 --> 00:58:23,760
extrude s to scale

1928
00:58:23,760 --> 00:58:26,480
maybe i to inset let's say we had

1929
00:58:26,480 --> 00:58:28,079
something like this now

1930
00:58:28,079 --> 00:58:30,799
and inset that one and then let's

1931
00:58:30,799 --> 00:58:32,880
duplicate this whole object now shift d

1932
00:58:32,880 --> 00:58:34,240
these are facing in the wrong direction

1933
00:58:34,240 --> 00:58:35,760
now because before remember we pressed

1934
00:58:35,760 --> 00:58:36,480
comma

1935
00:58:36,480 --> 00:58:38,400
to go into normal but we're going to go

1936
00:58:38,400 --> 00:58:40,079
back into global now so everything makes

1937
00:58:40,079 --> 00:58:42,000
sense i'll slide it on this red axis

1938
00:58:42,000 --> 00:58:44,000
and let's do something here item set

1939
00:58:44,000 --> 00:58:45,440
this one e to extrude

1940
00:58:45,440 --> 00:58:47,280
let's say we wanted to connect these two

1941
00:58:47,280 --> 00:58:48,880
now so we're in the same

1942
00:58:48,880 --> 00:58:50,720
object here now the cube here but we've

1943
00:58:50,720 --> 00:58:52,480
got two sets of geometries and sometimes

1944
00:58:52,480 --> 00:58:54,160
you want to connect this one here let's

1945
00:58:54,160 --> 00:58:56,000
slide this one out instead

1946
00:58:56,000 --> 00:58:57,920
so how do i go about connecting these

1947
00:58:57,920 --> 00:59:00,400
into one single mesh here you could just

1948
00:59:00,400 --> 00:59:03,920
select this face select that face type

1949
00:59:03,920 --> 00:59:04,240
press

1950
00:59:04,240 --> 00:59:07,200
f3 and type in bridge and then select

1951
00:59:07,200 --> 00:59:09,040
bridge edge loops here

1952
00:59:09,040 --> 00:59:11,119
and that links those together and we can

1953
00:59:11,119 --> 00:59:12,480
do alt z to make sure

1954
00:59:12,480 --> 00:59:14,079
it actually took away the center phase

1955
00:59:14,079 --> 00:59:15,920
that was in here as well so there's

1956
00:59:15,920 --> 00:59:17,760
no more center phase in there we can

1957
00:59:17,760 --> 00:59:19,119
actually double check here as well i'll

1958
00:59:19,119 --> 00:59:19,680
select

1959
00:59:19,680 --> 00:59:21,440
the loop around there and press h to

1960
00:59:21,440 --> 00:59:22,480
hide it and you can see that there are

1961
00:59:22,480 --> 00:59:23,760
no faces here as well

1962
00:59:23,760 --> 00:59:25,920
and then alt h on hide so if you wanted

1963
00:59:25,920 --> 00:59:27,200
to link these together

1964
00:59:27,200 --> 00:59:30,400
just select those two f3 bridge edge

1965
00:59:30,400 --> 00:59:31,040
loops

1966
00:59:31,040 --> 00:59:32,960
if you wanted to select these two up

1967
00:59:32,960 --> 00:59:34,960
here you can link those together as well

1968
00:59:34,960 --> 00:59:38,000
f3 bridge edge loops like that let's say

1969
00:59:38,000 --> 00:59:38,880
i wanted to model

1970
00:59:38,880 --> 00:59:41,599
top of a table with a computer a monitor

1971
00:59:41,599 --> 00:59:42,240
and a

1972
00:59:42,240 --> 00:59:44,400
keyboard on it let's do shift a as we've

1973
00:59:44,400 --> 00:59:46,160
done before we'll add a cube

1974
00:59:46,160 --> 00:59:48,400
and we'll go here bring shading make

1975
00:59:48,400 --> 00:59:49,920
sure we have the material selected

1976
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,680
go back to uv editing i'll select

1977
00:59:51,680 --> 00:59:53,280
everything i'm in edit mode now so i've

1978
00:59:53,280 --> 00:59:53,920
pressed tab

1979
00:59:53,920 --> 00:59:56,000
very important scale z and then we

1980
00:59:56,000 --> 00:59:57,599
flatten it down maybe like this

1981
00:59:57,599 --> 00:59:59,920
scale on the x axis make it wider so

1982
00:59:59,920 --> 01:00:00,720
we'll just make the

1983
01:00:00,720 --> 01:00:02,079
i'll skip the legs for now i'll just

1984
01:00:02,079 --> 01:00:03,839
make a table top here a

1985
01:00:03,839 --> 01:00:06,720
on the left side on the uv here scale 0

1986
01:00:06,720 --> 01:00:07,359
enter

1987
01:00:07,359 --> 01:00:09,280
and make a brown table top again so now

1988
01:00:09,280 --> 01:00:10,480
we're going to put a computer here and

1989
01:00:10,480 --> 01:00:12,079
this is something i do quite often to

1990
01:00:12,079 --> 01:00:13,280
save a lot of time

1991
01:00:13,280 --> 01:00:15,599
i select this table top just this face

1992
01:00:15,599 --> 01:00:16,559
here i'm three

1993
01:00:16,559 --> 01:00:18,720
in phase select here shift d to

1994
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:19,760
duplicate it

1995
01:00:19,760 --> 01:00:21,520
and you can see that it's loose here but

1996
01:00:21,520 --> 01:00:23,440
if i press right mouse button now it'll

1997
01:00:23,440 --> 01:00:25,040
snap it back to where it was

1998
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,200
but now we've got a separate face here

1999
01:00:27,200 --> 01:00:29,599
so i can press s to scale that face

2000
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:32,160
and s again and press x and scale it on

2001
01:00:32,160 --> 01:00:32,960
the x axis

2002
01:00:32,960 --> 01:00:35,280
and then move it to here and then now

2003
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:37,200
when i press e to extrude it

2004
01:00:37,200 --> 01:00:39,200
we've got a computer here and remember

2005
01:00:39,200 --> 01:00:40,960
that i can press l on this one to select

2006
01:00:40,960 --> 01:00:42,559
it we're still in the same object here

2007
01:00:42,559 --> 01:00:45,040
but since these vertices are only linked

2008
01:00:45,040 --> 01:00:47,520
to this face and the extruded part of it

2009
01:00:47,520 --> 01:00:49,440
it's not linked to the tabletop anymore

2010
01:00:49,440 --> 01:00:51,119
so we can control this separate

2011
01:00:51,119 --> 01:00:53,119
and then i'll press on the left here g

2012
01:00:53,119 --> 01:00:55,119
and move it to black so we make a black

2013
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:56,720
computer always cool to have a black

2014
01:00:56,720 --> 01:00:58,240
computer let's make a monitor

2015
01:00:58,240 --> 01:00:59,839
so in the same way i'll take the

2016
01:00:59,839 --> 01:01:02,160
tabletop here again shift d duplicate it

2017
01:01:02,160 --> 01:01:06,079
right click scale it down e to extrude

2018
01:01:06,079 --> 01:01:08,880
e to extrude again s to scale e to

2019
01:01:08,880 --> 01:01:09,760
extrude

2020
01:01:09,760 --> 01:01:11,280
let's actually press l here and move it

2021
01:01:11,280 --> 01:01:13,040
all the way to the side so we get some

2022
01:01:13,040 --> 01:01:13,920
space

2023
01:01:13,920 --> 01:01:16,720
e to extrude s to scale s to scale again

2024
01:01:16,720 --> 01:01:17,680
on the x axis

2025
01:01:17,680 --> 01:01:20,960
e to extrude and press l

2026
01:01:20,960 --> 01:01:24,000
to select all the links g here on the

2027
01:01:24,000 --> 01:01:26,079
left side move it to black

2028
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:29,680
let's do i to inset and e to extrude

2029
01:01:29,680 --> 01:01:31,680
and let's change g here and change this

2030
01:01:31,680 --> 01:01:33,200
to a blue screen of that

2031
01:01:33,200 --> 01:01:35,440
and let's make a keyboard so same i'll

2032
01:01:35,440 --> 01:01:36,640
pick this one shift d

2033
01:01:36,640 --> 01:01:39,920
to duplicate it scale it maybe move it

2034
01:01:39,920 --> 01:01:41,680
to here

2035
01:01:41,680 --> 01:01:45,040
scale e to extrude it l to select the

2036
01:01:45,040 --> 01:01:45,520
length

2037
01:01:45,520 --> 01:01:47,440
and g to move it maybe it's a great

2038
01:01:47,440 --> 01:01:49,280
keyboard say we wanted to make a chord

2039
01:01:49,280 --> 01:01:49,920
here as well

2040
01:01:49,920 --> 01:01:52,079
we could do the same here thing with lu

2041
01:01:52,079 --> 01:01:53,760
we can do the same thing i'll do shift d

2042
01:01:53,760 --> 01:01:54,640
to duplicate it

2043
01:01:54,640 --> 01:01:57,359
scale it down maybe scale it on the z

2044
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:58,400
axis

2045
01:01:58,400 --> 01:02:00,160
let's look from the top now and then

2046
01:02:00,160 --> 01:02:02,480
just remember we could hold the ctrl key

2047
01:02:02,480 --> 01:02:06,079
and then just right click

2048
01:02:06,079 --> 01:02:09,839
like this and then connect it to the

2049
01:02:09,839 --> 01:02:11,119
monitor

2050
01:02:11,119 --> 01:02:14,240
there maybe move it into the monitor

2051
01:02:14,240 --> 01:02:16,000
and it's hanging in the air now so maybe

2052
01:02:16,000 --> 01:02:17,920
we want to fix that i'll go into

2053
01:02:17,920 --> 01:02:20,559
two to edge select select any edge here

2054
01:02:20,559 --> 01:02:21,200
let's

2055
01:02:21,200 --> 01:02:23,839
press o to enable proportional editing

2056
01:02:23,839 --> 01:02:25,440
and g to move it down

2057
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,960
scroll it up a bit see that we're

2058
01:02:26,960 --> 01:02:28,640
distorting the computer now we don't

2059
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,000
really want to do that so let's right

2060
01:02:30,000 --> 01:02:30,480
click

2061
01:02:30,480 --> 01:02:33,680
to cancel that and do alt o to make sure

2062
01:02:33,680 --> 01:02:35,440
we only have the connected here

2063
01:02:35,440 --> 01:02:37,039
this one remember that it's connected

2064
01:02:37,039 --> 01:02:38,960
only now g to move it now we're only

2065
01:02:38,960 --> 01:02:40,799
affecting the chord no matter how big we

2066
01:02:40,799 --> 01:02:41,599
go

2067
01:02:41,599 --> 01:02:43,200
so we can hang the chord down to maybe

2068
01:02:43,200 --> 01:02:45,280
there select that one

2069
01:02:45,280 --> 01:02:49,440
scroll it down that one scroll it down

2070
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:52,799
so now we've created a low poly cord

2071
01:02:52,799 --> 01:02:54,240
that's hanging maybe we wanted to even

2072
01:02:54,240 --> 01:02:55,920
hang off the table a little bit

2073
01:02:55,920 --> 01:02:57,359
have to be careful maybe we want to

2074
01:02:57,359 --> 01:02:59,760
rotate it bring it down

2075
01:02:59,760 --> 01:03:02,240
move that one there just make sure you

2076
01:03:02,240 --> 01:03:02,799
don't

2077
01:03:02,799 --> 01:03:05,280
twist the the stuff too much i probably

2078
01:03:05,280 --> 01:03:07,440
went a little bit overboard here

2079
01:03:07,440 --> 01:03:09,440
so be careful with that so this is still

2080
01:03:09,440 --> 01:03:11,200
again the same object but let's say we

2081
01:03:11,200 --> 01:03:12,880
wanted to detach this now into a

2082
01:03:12,880 --> 01:03:14,400
separate let's say we wanted to detach

2083
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,200
the monitor

2084
01:03:15,200 --> 01:03:17,039
we can actually double click a to make

2085
01:03:17,039 --> 01:03:18,799
sure nothing is selected

2086
01:03:18,799 --> 01:03:20,960
press l over the monitor here and now

2087
01:03:20,960 --> 01:03:22,240
there's a hotkey called

2088
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:26,160
p and then separate selection

2089
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:27,680
and now we've created a separate one

2090
01:03:27,680 --> 01:03:29,920
here and that's our monitor and this one

2091
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,960
first here is the

2092
01:03:30,960 --> 01:03:33,440
other combined if i control z that you

2093
01:03:33,440 --> 01:03:35,039
could actually do this as well

2094
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:38,720
you can select everything p and separate

2095
01:03:38,720 --> 01:03:40,960
by loose parts and now it's created all

2096
01:03:40,960 --> 01:03:43,039
of these for us so i can go to this one

2097
01:03:43,039 --> 01:03:47,440
name this one monitor here is our

2098
01:03:47,440 --> 01:03:49,920
computer

2099
01:03:50,799 --> 01:03:54,160
here's our very basic keyboard

2100
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:59,359
and here's our tabletop

2101
01:03:59,359 --> 01:04:00,960
maybe we wanted some legs on this table

2102
01:04:00,960 --> 01:04:02,480
as well after all

2103
01:04:02,480 --> 01:04:04,079
so we can do the same thing here i do

2104
01:04:04,079 --> 01:04:05,520
shift d to duplicate it

2105
01:04:05,520 --> 01:04:08,559
scale it down scale it on the x axis

2106
01:04:08,559 --> 01:04:10,720
move it into move it into the place of a

2107
01:04:10,720 --> 01:04:12,400
leg here maybe

2108
01:04:12,400 --> 01:04:15,680
so we slide it on these axis and then e

2109
01:04:15,680 --> 01:04:17,680
to extrude it down

2110
01:04:17,680 --> 01:04:19,839
maybe we do ctrl 7 to go to the bottom

2111
01:04:19,839 --> 01:04:20,799
view because

2112
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,880
i didn't mention that before but 7 is

2113
01:04:22,880 --> 01:04:25,359
the top view but control 7 is the bottom

2114
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:26,160
view

2115
01:04:26,160 --> 01:04:29,280
press l to select the link here shift d

2116
01:04:29,280 --> 01:04:31,680
to duplicate it right click to snap it

2117
01:04:31,680 --> 01:04:32,480
back

2118
01:04:32,480 --> 01:04:35,200
move it on this axis and let's press l

2119
01:04:35,200 --> 01:04:37,520
over this one so we select both legs

2120
01:04:37,520 --> 01:04:40,000
shift d to duplicate it and then move it

2121
01:04:40,000 --> 01:04:41,839
roughly today

2122
01:04:41,839 --> 01:04:43,760
and then now we've got some legs on that

2123
01:04:43,760 --> 01:04:45,520
table as well equally like we did with

2124
01:04:45,520 --> 01:04:46,960
separate before you can actually bring

2125
01:04:46,960 --> 01:04:48,559
them back into the same object again if

2126
01:04:48,559 --> 01:04:49,680
you want to we could

2127
01:04:49,680 --> 01:04:51,760
select this one hold the shift key to

2128
01:04:51,760 --> 01:04:53,520
all of these for example

2129
01:04:53,520 --> 01:04:56,559
and that one and then do control j

2130
01:04:56,559 --> 01:04:58,799
and that merges it into it'll pick the

2131
01:04:58,799 --> 01:04:59,599
latest name

2132
01:04:59,599 --> 01:05:04,160
here that you had computer

2133
01:05:04,160 --> 01:05:06,559
stuff and i think the chord is still a

2134
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,000
separate one here so we can

2135
01:05:08,000 --> 01:05:10,559
click that one click that one and do

2136
01:05:10,559 --> 01:05:12,000
control

2137
01:05:12,000 --> 01:05:13,520
j to join that one as well and now

2138
01:05:13,520 --> 01:05:15,119
suddenly it's in one object again so

2139
01:05:15,119 --> 01:05:16,799
remember that you can separate it with p

2140
01:05:16,799 --> 01:05:18,559
into separate objects if you want to

2141
01:05:18,559 --> 01:05:19,839
export it for the game and have

2142
01:05:19,839 --> 01:05:21,839
everything separate that's fine and you

2143
01:05:21,839 --> 01:05:24,559
can join stuff together again with the

2144
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:28,400
control j also very useful

2145
01:05:29,280 --> 01:05:30,559
now we're going to get into some

2146
01:05:30,559 --> 01:05:32,559
modifiers are you still with me are you

2147
01:05:32,559 --> 01:05:33,200
still awake

2148
01:05:33,200 --> 01:05:35,520
i'm barely what time is it 3 15 in the

2149
01:05:35,520 --> 01:05:36,880
morning i love this stuff

2150
01:05:36,880 --> 01:05:38,160
can't get enough of it that's why i'm

2151
01:05:38,160 --> 01:05:40,079
going to keep going so we're going to do

2152
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:41,039
a modifier here

2153
01:05:41,039 --> 01:05:43,200
and it's going to be the mirror modifier

2154
01:05:43,200 --> 01:05:44,559
very useful if you want to model a

2155
01:05:44,559 --> 01:05:46,559
spaceship for example and so you go

2156
01:05:46,559 --> 01:05:47,760
on the right side here with the object

2157
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:49,839
selected in object mode you go to this

2158
01:05:49,839 --> 01:05:50,319
wrench

2159
01:05:50,319 --> 01:05:52,960
icon and then add modifier and mirror

2160
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:54,640
and it'll look a bit weird here because

2161
01:05:54,640 --> 01:05:56,480
it doesn't really know how to mirror it

2162
01:05:56,480 --> 01:05:58,400
it's mirroring it on the x-axis here by

2163
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:00,000
default you can control which axis you

2164
01:06:00,000 --> 01:06:00,799
do i always

2165
01:06:00,799 --> 01:06:02,480
use the x-axis for mirroring but it

2166
01:06:02,480 --> 01:06:04,079
doesn't look mirrored now so we don't

2167
01:06:04,079 --> 01:06:05,920
know what's going on and that's because

2168
01:06:05,920 --> 01:06:08,640
this geometry is going past the center

2169
01:06:08,640 --> 01:06:09,200
here

2170
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:11,760
if i take this face and move it you can

2171
01:06:11,760 --> 01:06:12,880
see that it's still there

2172
01:06:12,880 --> 01:06:14,799
which is really strange but it's because

2173
01:06:14,799 --> 01:06:16,640
it's mirroring this part of the green

2174
01:06:16,640 --> 01:06:17,039
side

2175
01:06:17,039 --> 01:06:20,079
of the y-axis here on the x-axis it's

2176
01:06:20,079 --> 01:06:21,200
mirroring that part

2177
01:06:21,200 --> 01:06:23,839
so in order to to get into a cube that's

2178
01:06:23,839 --> 01:06:24,480
mirrored

2179
01:06:24,480 --> 01:06:25,920
you'd have to if you do it manually

2180
01:06:25,920 --> 01:06:27,680
you'd have to delete that face

2181
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:30,559
and then press two maybe and alt select

2182
01:06:30,559 --> 01:06:32,079
this ring and then bring it back and

2183
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,240
it's difficult to know exactly how far

2184
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,079
but you can enable this clipping feature

2185
01:06:36,079 --> 01:06:37,440
here because

2186
01:06:37,440 --> 01:06:39,039
then it'll detect that when you hit the

2187
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:40,640
center here it won't allow you to go

2188
01:06:40,640 --> 01:06:41,359
past it

2189
01:06:41,359 --> 01:06:42,880
but we've got proportional editing on

2190
01:06:42,880 --> 01:06:44,400
still so disable that

2191
01:06:44,400 --> 01:06:46,319
so when i move it now it'll detect that

2192
01:06:46,319 --> 01:06:47,920
oh i'm going to glue you together now

2193
01:06:47,920 --> 01:06:49,839
because we've hit the center so now if i

2194
01:06:49,839 --> 01:06:51,359
try to move this one it doesn't work

2195
01:06:51,359 --> 01:06:52,160
because clipping

2196
01:06:52,160 --> 01:06:53,760
is preventing us from doing that so most

2197
01:06:53,760 --> 01:06:55,200
of the time that's what you want to do

2198
01:06:55,200 --> 01:06:56,559
saying all of this there's actually a

2199
01:06:56,559 --> 01:06:57,760
great way that you should do this

2200
01:06:57,760 --> 01:06:59,200
instead

2201
01:06:59,200 --> 01:07:00,640
so instead of applying this mirror

2202
01:07:00,640 --> 01:07:02,400
modifier here you go to

2203
01:07:02,400 --> 01:07:05,839
edit preferences and then here you go to

2204
01:07:05,839 --> 01:07:06,640
add-ons

2205
01:07:06,640 --> 01:07:09,920
and then type here you can type in auto

2206
01:07:09,920 --> 01:07:11,599
mirror i have this one enabled by

2207
01:07:11,599 --> 01:07:13,039
default because i love this one

2208
01:07:13,039 --> 01:07:14,960
so make sure you have that one enabled

2209
01:07:14,960 --> 01:07:17,200
and now when you click on the object

2210
01:07:17,200 --> 01:07:19,280
you can press n on your keyboard to get

2211
01:07:19,280 --> 01:07:22,160
this little menu here and go to edit

2212
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:23,839
and now you have this magic one called

2213
01:07:23,839 --> 01:07:25,680
auto mirror so click on that one

2214
01:07:25,680 --> 01:07:27,359
and that just did everything that i did

2215
01:07:27,359 --> 01:07:29,520
manually if i tab into now it's already

2216
01:07:29,520 --> 01:07:31,039
got the perfect slit here it's got

2217
01:07:31,039 --> 01:07:32,319
clipping enabled

2218
01:07:32,319 --> 01:07:34,319
everything is ready to go so save

2219
01:07:34,319 --> 01:07:36,079
yourself a lot of time and hassle by

2220
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:36,720
doing that

2221
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,799
use auto mirror another useful modifier

2222
01:07:38,799 --> 01:07:40,799
is the displays modifier if i do

2223
01:07:40,799 --> 01:07:43,119
shift a here this time let's add a plane

2224
01:07:43,119 --> 01:07:44,480
tab into edit mode

2225
01:07:44,480 --> 01:07:46,400
scale it up a lot tab out of edit mode

2226
01:07:46,400 --> 01:07:48,000
and ctrl 5

2227
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:49,520
and now we can actually go into simple

2228
01:07:49,520 --> 01:07:50,960
now because we just want to subdivide

2229
01:07:50,960 --> 01:07:52,240
this one it doesn't look any different

2230
01:07:52,240 --> 01:07:52,799
now

2231
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:55,039
but if i apply this one and tab into

2232
01:07:55,039 --> 01:07:56,880
edit mode you can see that it subdivided

2233
01:07:56,880 --> 01:07:57,119
it

2234
01:07:57,119 --> 01:07:59,119
a lot of times here to create this grid

2235
01:07:59,119 --> 01:08:00,880
instead let's actually subdivide this

2236
01:08:00,880 --> 01:08:02,079
one one more time so

2237
01:08:02,079 --> 01:08:04,720
i select the object press control two

2238
01:08:04,720 --> 01:08:05,520
simple

2239
01:08:05,520 --> 01:08:07,520
and apply it and now we've got even more

2240
01:08:07,520 --> 01:08:09,359
geometry here so if you wanted to create

2241
01:08:09,359 --> 01:08:10,799
a low poly island or

2242
01:08:10,799 --> 01:08:12,799
you could uh enable this proportional

2243
01:08:12,799 --> 01:08:15,200
editing and then select the vertex

2244
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,960
press g to move it and then use the

2245
01:08:16,960 --> 01:08:18,238
mouse wheel to start

2246
01:08:18,238 --> 01:08:19,839
changing this you could also what we

2247
01:08:19,839 --> 01:08:22,080
learned before ctrl right click to lasso

2248
01:08:22,080 --> 01:08:23,120
select something

2249
01:08:23,120 --> 01:08:25,839
and press g and then use proportional

2250
01:08:25,839 --> 01:08:28,000
editing here to start creating

2251
01:08:28,000 --> 01:08:29,679
different shapes to your island that's

2252
01:08:29,679 --> 01:08:31,759
one way to do it but i wanted to show

2253
01:08:31,759 --> 01:08:32,158
this

2254
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,000
displays modifier so if i go to add

2255
01:08:34,000 --> 01:08:35,679
modifier here displace

2256
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,198
and i have to tab out of edit mode to

2257
01:08:37,198 --> 01:08:39,040
see it now i can click new here on

2258
01:08:39,040 --> 01:08:40,158
texture

2259
01:08:40,158 --> 01:08:42,080
and on this little icon here and let's

2260
01:08:42,080 --> 01:08:43,279
switch the type here

2261
01:08:43,279 --> 01:08:45,920
to clouds for example and change the

2262
01:08:45,920 --> 01:08:47,040
scale

2263
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,080
to this maybe two and then we can go

2264
01:08:50,080 --> 01:08:51,040
back into

2265
01:08:51,040 --> 01:08:53,279
this modifier tab here and change the

2266
01:08:53,279 --> 01:08:54,960
strength maybe we wanted to

2267
01:08:54,960 --> 01:08:56,560
tweak this one even more maybe we wanted

2268
01:08:56,560 --> 01:08:58,000
this one to scale

2269
01:08:58,000 --> 01:09:01,839
4 or 10. increase the scale even more

2270
01:09:01,839 --> 01:09:03,920
so here's a useful thing and if you

2271
01:09:03,920 --> 01:09:05,040
wanted to make it

2272
01:09:05,040 --> 01:09:06,640
maybe you wanted to add something like a

2273
01:09:06,640 --> 01:09:08,319
water thing there you could go into this

2274
01:09:08,319 --> 01:09:09,120
color one

2275
01:09:09,120 --> 01:09:12,159
and do color ramp

2276
01:09:12,399 --> 01:09:16,158
and then you slide this bottom one

2277
01:09:16,479 --> 01:09:18,399
it takes away details from the lower

2278
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:20,238
part of the of the randomness so it

2279
01:09:20,238 --> 01:09:21,198
creates like

2280
01:09:21,198 --> 01:09:22,799
the surface of a c here and if you're

2281
01:09:22,799 --> 01:09:24,399
happy with this you could

2282
01:09:24,399 --> 01:09:26,080
go back to this modifier here and just

2283
01:09:26,080 --> 01:09:28,319
click apply and now we've created

2284
01:09:28,319 --> 01:09:29,600
something that looks a little bit like a

2285
01:09:29,600 --> 01:09:31,198
low poly landscape we could decimate

2286
01:09:31,198 --> 01:09:32,640
this one again because it still doesn't

2287
01:09:32,640 --> 01:09:34,479
look very low poly so we can go add

2288
01:09:34,479 --> 01:09:35,359
modifier

2289
01:09:35,359 --> 01:09:37,520
decimate it like we did before and slide

2290
01:09:37,520 --> 01:09:38,799
this one down

2291
01:09:38,799 --> 01:09:40,640
and that brings it into like a low poly

2292
01:09:40,640 --> 01:09:42,399
landscape and then apply that one we

2293
01:09:42,399 --> 01:09:43,839
have some issues here as well

2294
01:09:43,839 --> 01:09:45,198
if we wanted to fix that we could do

2295
01:09:45,198 --> 01:09:47,359
that we can select those two vertices

2296
01:09:47,359 --> 01:09:50,719
press x and dissolve vertices so if you

2297
01:09:50,719 --> 01:09:52,960
have some problem areas like that

2298
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:55,760
x this is all vertices we could do one

2299
01:09:55,760 --> 01:09:56,239
to get

2300
01:09:56,239 --> 01:09:59,360
the side view alt z

2301
01:09:59,360 --> 01:10:01,840
to see all of this trickiness b to box

2302
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:02,800
select

2303
01:10:02,800 --> 01:10:04,320
and then just select the very bottom

2304
01:10:04,320 --> 01:10:06,960
here as slow down as we can

2305
01:10:06,960 --> 01:10:09,199
and now we've selected all the bottom

2306
01:10:09,199 --> 01:10:10,159
faces more or less

2307
01:10:10,159 --> 01:10:12,239
alt said to snap out of that on and we

2308
01:10:12,239 --> 01:10:13,679
haven't actually changed the

2309
01:10:13,679 --> 01:10:15,040
material here so let's change the

2310
01:10:15,040 --> 01:10:17,840
material go back into uv editing

2311
01:10:17,840 --> 01:10:19,199
a to select everything on the left that

2312
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,120
we selected scale

2313
01:10:21,120 --> 01:10:23,679
0 and now we can select that one to blue

2314
01:10:23,679 --> 01:10:24,880
if we wanted

2315
01:10:24,880 --> 01:10:26,320
but what about the rest well we can

2316
01:10:26,320 --> 01:10:29,199
press ctrl i to flip the selection

2317
01:10:29,199 --> 01:10:32,960
and then a on the left side scale 0

2318
01:10:32,960 --> 01:10:35,199
g to move it maybe to green so that's

2319
01:10:35,199 --> 01:10:36,800
one way to create something that looks a

2320
01:10:36,800 --> 01:10:38,400
little bit like a low poly landscape

2321
01:10:38,400 --> 01:10:40,239
if it's too steep for example you can

2322
01:10:40,239 --> 01:10:41,440
select everything

2323
01:10:41,440 --> 01:10:44,320
scale z to flatten it again let's say we

2324
01:10:44,320 --> 01:10:45,040
wanted some

2325
01:10:45,040 --> 01:10:48,239
uh white snow capped tops here make sure

2326
01:10:48,239 --> 01:10:50,000
we're in edit mode here maybe press

2327
01:10:50,000 --> 01:10:52,560
uh one to vertex select double click a

2328
01:10:52,560 --> 01:10:53,840
to deselect everything

2329
01:10:53,840 --> 01:10:57,360
b to box select and let's go like this

2330
01:10:57,360 --> 01:10:58,880
switch into face selector mode with

2331
01:10:58,880 --> 01:11:01,040
three again maybe we still want

2332
01:11:01,040 --> 01:11:03,360
let's say we wanted some uh gray

2333
01:11:03,360 --> 01:11:05,120
mountains first we could do control plus

2334
01:11:05,120 --> 01:11:06,159
a few times

2335
01:11:06,159 --> 01:11:07,760
maybe to there on the left side here

2336
01:11:07,760 --> 01:11:09,760
we've also got some water selected now

2337
01:11:09,760 --> 01:11:11,679
if we didn't want that to be selected we

2338
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,520
could see it's these we could maybe

2339
01:11:13,520 --> 01:11:16,880
deselect these manually like this

2340
01:11:16,880 --> 01:11:18,880
if it's tricky to see where the water is

2341
01:11:18,880 --> 01:11:20,400
selected and stuff you can actually

2342
01:11:20,400 --> 01:11:21,760
click on this little thing here called

2343
01:11:21,760 --> 01:11:23,440
uv sync selection

2344
01:11:23,440 --> 01:11:26,560
because now if i do be shift select that

2345
01:11:26,560 --> 01:11:28,480
one it'll deselect edit anything that

2346
01:11:28,480 --> 01:11:29,199
had

2347
01:11:29,199 --> 01:11:31,280
that blue color and then we can switch

2348
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:32,640
this back on again so now we

2349
01:11:32,640 --> 01:11:34,000
we've ensured that we don't have any

2350
01:11:34,000 --> 01:11:35,920
water selected and then i can do

2351
01:11:35,920 --> 01:11:38,080
g here and go to gray maybe and then

2352
01:11:38,080 --> 01:11:38,960
ctrl minus

2353
01:11:38,960 --> 01:11:41,760
maybe three times and then g and move

2354
01:11:41,760 --> 01:11:42,800
that to byte

2355
01:11:42,800 --> 01:11:44,960
and tab out of edit mode and now we've

2356
01:11:44,960 --> 01:11:46,239
created something that looks a little

2357
01:11:46,239 --> 01:11:46,880
bit like a

2358
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:48,880
low poly landscape one more modifier

2359
01:11:48,880 --> 01:11:50,960
that's quite useful and that is the skin

2360
01:11:50,960 --> 01:11:51,760
modifier

2361
01:11:51,760 --> 01:11:53,600
if you wanted to create a tree again for

2362
01:11:53,600 --> 01:11:55,760
example you could do here we can

2363
01:11:55,760 --> 01:11:58,080
there's actually another useful thing

2364
01:11:58,080 --> 01:12:00,320
here you can go to preferences

2365
01:12:00,320 --> 01:12:02,880
and then here we type extra objects

2366
01:12:02,880 --> 01:12:04,159
enable that one

2367
01:12:04,159 --> 01:12:06,719
because now when we press shift a we can

2368
01:12:06,719 --> 01:12:08,560
actually add a mesh but we can add

2369
01:12:08,560 --> 01:12:11,040
a single vert it'll bring us into vertex

2370
01:12:11,040 --> 01:12:11,840
edit mode here

2371
01:12:11,840 --> 01:12:13,920
and now zoom out a little bit and i hold

2372
01:12:13,920 --> 01:12:15,040
the ctrl key and i

2373
01:12:15,040 --> 01:12:18,719
just right click a bit like this

2374
01:12:18,719 --> 01:12:20,560
and then i select this vertex right

2375
01:12:20,560 --> 01:12:22,640
click select that vertex

2376
01:12:22,640 --> 01:12:24,640
right click a few times with the control

2377
01:12:24,640 --> 01:12:27,199
key by the way

2378
01:12:27,199 --> 01:12:29,360
so control key right click right click

2379
01:12:29,360 --> 01:12:31,440
right click i'll hold the ctrl key

2380
01:12:31,440 --> 01:12:33,199
right click right click and i rotate the

2381
01:12:33,199 --> 01:12:34,800
viewport a little bit now when we've got

2382
01:12:34,800 --> 01:12:35,280
this

2383
01:12:35,280 --> 01:12:36,719
that looks a bit like a tree trunk we

2384
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:38,480
can add the modifier here

2385
01:12:38,480 --> 01:12:40,880
and add the skin modifier see that it's

2386
01:12:40,880 --> 01:12:42,320
a little bit too thick now

2387
01:12:42,320 --> 01:12:44,159
tab into make sure you're in edit mode

2388
01:12:44,159 --> 01:12:45,840
so you see these vertices

2389
01:12:45,840 --> 01:12:47,679
press a to select all of them and then

2390
01:12:47,679 --> 01:12:50,640
ctrl a and that's the hotkey to scale

2391
01:12:50,640 --> 01:12:52,560
vertices for skinning for the skinning

2392
01:12:52,560 --> 01:12:55,280
modifier here shift deselect that one

2393
01:12:55,280 --> 01:12:58,000
let's enable proportional with o we

2394
01:12:58,000 --> 01:12:59,440
can't do scale remember we have to do

2395
01:12:59,440 --> 01:13:00,320
ctrl a

2396
01:13:00,320 --> 01:13:02,640
for the skinning one and then scale it

2397
01:13:02,640 --> 01:13:04,080
down and we don't want symmetry on

2398
01:13:04,080 --> 01:13:04,640
either

2399
01:13:04,640 --> 01:13:08,000
and then this one ctrl a

2400
01:13:08,000 --> 01:13:10,159
to scale and then roll up proportional

2401
01:13:10,159 --> 01:13:11,520
so this is how you could create

2402
01:13:11,520 --> 01:13:14,239
three branches

2403
01:13:15,199 --> 01:13:16,960
if you remember before we enable this

2404
01:13:16,960 --> 01:13:18,960
thing called vertex snapping and we used

2405
01:13:18,960 --> 01:13:21,280
it to snap one of these vertices

2406
01:13:21,280 --> 01:13:23,600
onto another one like this pow but one

2407
01:13:23,600 --> 01:13:25,040
thing that's really really useful let's

2408
01:13:25,040 --> 01:13:25,760
say you had

2409
01:13:25,760 --> 01:13:27,360
another line there and let's say that

2410
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:29,120
one was a bit wonky that one was a bit

2411
01:13:29,120 --> 01:13:29,600
wonky

2412
01:13:29,600 --> 01:13:31,360
you can actually use the vertex snap on

2413
01:13:31,360 --> 01:13:32,960
an axis as well click

2414
01:13:32,960 --> 01:13:35,199
on this axis here that we have before

2415
01:13:35,199 --> 01:13:36,560
again if that's not enabled

2416
01:13:36,560 --> 01:13:38,719
you can go up here drop down and have

2417
01:13:38,719 --> 01:13:40,640
this one enabled or you can press

2418
01:13:40,640 --> 01:13:43,120
shift space and g to enable it as well

2419
01:13:43,120 --> 01:13:44,560
that's the same as clicking on this move

2420
01:13:44,560 --> 01:13:46,239
tool here and now if i move

2421
01:13:46,239 --> 01:13:48,400
on this axis and then i hold the ctrl

2422
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:49,360
key

2423
01:13:49,360 --> 01:13:51,280
and then snap it to there it'll only

2424
01:13:51,280 --> 01:13:53,440
snap it on the x axis to that one

2425
01:13:53,440 --> 01:13:54,960
and this is really really good if you

2426
01:13:54,960 --> 01:13:56,719
want to align to make sure that they're

2427
01:13:56,719 --> 01:13:57,360
on the same

2428
01:13:57,360 --> 01:14:00,159
on the same distance on the on one axis

2429
01:14:00,159 --> 01:14:01,040
similarly

2430
01:14:01,040 --> 01:14:02,320
if i wanted to bring this one up and

2431
01:14:02,320 --> 01:14:03,920
make sure it's the same height as this

2432
01:14:03,920 --> 01:14:04,239
one

2433
01:14:04,239 --> 01:14:06,400
move it on this one hold the ctrl key

2434
01:14:06,400 --> 01:14:07,360
and move it

2435
01:14:07,360 --> 01:14:09,120
and move it so you get that little

2436
01:14:09,120 --> 01:14:10,719
circle and then we can see here that

2437
01:14:10,719 --> 01:14:12,320
that one's poking out we wanted to bring

2438
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:14,239
that one into the same as there move it

2439
01:14:14,239 --> 01:14:15,199
on the green axis

2440
01:14:15,199 --> 01:14:17,679
on the y axis hold the ctrl key and snap

2441
01:14:17,679 --> 01:14:19,120
it to that one so if you want to do

2442
01:14:19,120 --> 01:14:20,159
aligning

2443
01:14:20,159 --> 01:14:22,400
vertex snapping on an axis is really

2444
01:14:22,400 --> 01:14:24,719
useful

2445
01:14:25,679 --> 01:14:27,920
we've already enabled automator here but

2446
01:14:27,920 --> 01:14:29,360
there are a couple of more ones i'd like

2447
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:30,000
to mention

2448
01:14:30,000 --> 01:14:33,360
so in preferences under add-ons one good

2449
01:14:33,360 --> 01:14:34,000
is

2450
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:36,640
loop tools so make sure you enable that

2451
01:14:36,640 --> 01:14:37,840
one

2452
01:14:37,840 --> 01:14:40,880
and another one while i'm here is f2

2453
01:14:40,880 --> 01:14:44,719
we'll enable that one too and one more

2454
01:14:44,719 --> 01:14:47,840
is bool tools let's enable that one

2455
01:14:47,840 --> 01:14:49,760
and i'll show you what these two as well

2456
01:14:49,760 --> 01:14:51,040
so if i do shift

2457
01:14:51,040 --> 01:14:54,840
a mesh cube here we've got a normal cube

2458
01:14:54,840 --> 01:14:56,000
again

2459
01:14:56,000 --> 01:14:59,440
let's subdivide this one ctrl 3 maybe

2460
01:14:59,440 --> 01:15:01,760
and apply that one and let's say you

2461
01:15:01,760 --> 01:15:02,719
wanted to make

2462
01:15:02,719 --> 01:15:04,800
these if you wanted to extrude these but

2463
01:15:04,800 --> 01:15:05,760
you wanted them to be

2464
01:15:05,760 --> 01:15:07,679
circle shape so if i shift select these

2465
01:15:07,679 --> 01:15:09,520
and extrude it's like a square thing

2466
01:15:09,520 --> 01:15:10,400
that i'm doing

2467
01:15:10,400 --> 01:15:12,480
so ctrl z on that one and then we've got

2468
01:15:12,480 --> 01:15:13,440
loop tools here

2469
01:15:13,440 --> 01:15:14,719
you've got a few things i won't go

2470
01:15:14,719 --> 01:15:15,679
through all of them now you can

2471
01:15:15,679 --> 01:15:16,960
experiment with these

2472
01:15:16,960 --> 01:15:18,960
but one for example is circle here and

2473
01:15:18,960 --> 01:15:20,800
that just basically takes that square

2474
01:15:20,800 --> 01:15:21,360
and

2475
01:15:21,360 --> 01:15:23,520
makes it a circle and now when i extrude

2476
01:15:23,520 --> 01:15:25,280
it's more like a round thing so that's

2477
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:26,560
very useful but there are some other

2478
01:15:26,560 --> 01:15:26,880
good

2479
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,480
things here as well like flatten that we

2480
01:15:28,480 --> 01:15:30,159
did before we've got uh

2481
01:15:30,159 --> 01:15:32,480
bridge and all sorts of stuff the other

2482
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:34,239
thing which is really good is the bull

2483
01:15:34,239 --> 01:15:35,040
tools one

2484
01:15:35,040 --> 01:15:37,920
and again if i edit here it's a bool

2485
01:15:37,920 --> 01:15:38,800
tool here

2486
01:15:38,800 --> 01:15:41,440
if i do shift d to duplicate this and

2487
01:15:41,440 --> 01:15:42,640
then i select this one

2488
01:15:42,640 --> 01:15:44,560
shift select that one and then i'll do

2489
01:15:44,560 --> 01:15:46,159
control shift

2490
01:15:46,159 --> 01:15:49,280
minus on the keypad then it basically

2491
01:15:49,280 --> 01:15:50,560
cuts that first mesh

2492
01:15:50,560 --> 01:15:52,640
out of this one again very useful maybe

2493
01:15:52,640 --> 01:15:54,000
you wanted to create a moon or something

2494
01:15:54,000 --> 01:15:54,880
like that

2495
01:15:54,880 --> 01:15:58,159
so maybe we scale this one

2496
01:15:58,159 --> 01:16:01,840
off with proportional scale it down

2497
01:16:02,000 --> 01:16:05,360
do a few of these i'll select this one

2498
01:16:05,360 --> 01:16:07,760
shift to like this one ctrl shift minus

2499
01:16:07,760 --> 01:16:08,560
on the keypad

2500
01:16:08,560 --> 01:16:11,679
i'll select this one this one

2501
01:16:11,679 --> 01:16:14,880
ctrl minus select this one remember

2502
01:16:14,880 --> 01:16:17,760
shift select that one ctrl shift minus

2503
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,000
on the keypad

2504
01:16:20,000 --> 01:16:21,920
so bool tool very useful especially to

2505
01:16:21,920 --> 01:16:23,199
do subtractive

2506
01:16:23,199 --> 01:16:25,440
boolean operations and then the next one

2507
01:16:25,440 --> 01:16:26,960
is the f2 that i did

2508
01:16:26,960 --> 01:16:29,920
and for example if you have let's say we

2509
01:16:29,920 --> 01:16:32,400
have a bunch of these cutaway

2510
01:16:32,400 --> 01:16:35,760
press delete faces f2 will do this for

2511
01:16:35,760 --> 01:16:36,239
you

2512
01:16:36,239 --> 01:16:38,640
remember that we created faces before uh

2513
01:16:38,640 --> 01:16:39,520
we could do

2514
01:16:39,520 --> 01:16:41,360
everything and press f to create one big

2515
01:16:41,360 --> 01:16:42,880
weird face

2516
01:16:42,880 --> 01:16:45,199
but f2 add-on will do this for you

2517
01:16:45,199 --> 01:16:46,080
select this one

2518
01:16:46,080 --> 01:16:49,760
press f ffff it'll automatically fill

2519
01:16:49,760 --> 01:16:51,280
that together for you into

2520
01:16:51,280 --> 01:16:54,960
usually a quite a good sequence

2521
01:16:56,320 --> 01:16:58,480
all right i want to finish off this uh

2522
01:16:58,480 --> 01:17:00,480
lengthy video with a few tips as well if

2523
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:01,840
you run into issues

2524
01:17:01,840 --> 01:17:03,280
there could be a few tips maybe that you

2525
01:17:03,280 --> 01:17:04,719
can look into so one thing that you

2526
01:17:04,719 --> 01:17:06,719
might run into is parallel faces

2527
01:17:06,719 --> 01:17:09,760
and if you select this one and then if

2528
01:17:09,760 --> 01:17:10,000
you

2529
01:17:10,000 --> 01:17:13,360
extrude now up then you've actually got

2530
01:17:13,360 --> 01:17:15,360
this face here is sliding down between

2531
01:17:15,360 --> 01:17:16,400
and that's not really good

2532
01:17:16,400 --> 01:17:17,760
you don't want that so there's a few

2533
01:17:17,760 --> 01:17:19,679
things that you could do to fix this

2534
01:17:19,679 --> 01:17:22,080
one way to do it is if we've got this

2535
01:17:22,080 --> 01:17:23,920
auto merge vertices here i could do

2536
01:17:23,920 --> 01:17:26,159
control r add a loop cut here and slide

2537
01:17:26,159 --> 01:17:29,040
it down roughly to that place

2538
01:17:29,040 --> 01:17:31,280
and if i made it close enough which i

2539
01:17:31,280 --> 01:17:32,719
didn't because they're still separate

2540
01:17:32,719 --> 01:17:34,159
there then it's uh

2541
01:17:34,159 --> 01:17:35,679
it would have fixed it i'll select this

2542
01:17:35,679 --> 01:17:38,159
vertex press g to move it

2543
01:17:38,159 --> 01:17:40,480
ctrl and snap it onto that one since

2544
01:17:40,480 --> 01:17:41,280
i've got this

2545
01:17:41,280 --> 01:17:43,679
vertex snapping on here same thing for

2546
01:17:43,679 --> 01:17:45,040
this one select that

2547
01:17:45,040 --> 01:17:47,040
and that vertex is actually dug into

2548
01:17:47,040 --> 01:17:49,120
here so i do alt z to see through

2549
01:17:49,120 --> 01:17:52,159
select that one alt set g to move it and

2550
01:17:52,159 --> 01:17:53,760
snap it on to there

2551
01:17:53,760 --> 01:17:56,159
and now and then if i move this vertex

2552
01:17:56,159 --> 01:17:57,840
now you can see that we don't have any

2553
01:17:57,840 --> 01:17:59,679
double faces there anymore and if i do

2554
01:17:59,679 --> 01:18:01,199
old set i can also see

2555
01:18:01,199 --> 01:18:03,760
on three here we've got an issue still

2556
01:18:03,760 --> 01:18:04,320
we've got an

2557
01:18:04,320 --> 01:18:06,480
internal face here that was created due

2558
01:18:06,480 --> 01:18:08,400
to this you can only see that with old

2559
01:18:08,400 --> 01:18:10,000
said here and i've got that selected

2560
01:18:10,000 --> 01:18:10,880
there

2561
01:18:10,880 --> 01:18:12,560
and then you can just press delete and

2562
01:18:12,560 --> 01:18:14,480
delete that face and now we see that

2563
01:18:14,480 --> 01:18:15,440
there is no dot

2564
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:18,159
here anymore in the center alt z so

2565
01:18:18,159 --> 01:18:19,920
everything's fixed we've now fixed that

2566
01:18:19,920 --> 01:18:20,400
double

2567
01:18:20,400 --> 01:18:22,159
alignment the other thing that we had is

2568
01:18:22,159 --> 01:18:24,159
if we don't have this enabled we could

2569
01:18:24,159 --> 01:18:25,600
have some duplicate vertices

2570
01:18:25,600 --> 01:18:28,800
sometimes so if i do control r loop cut

2571
01:18:28,800 --> 01:18:29,600
that one

2572
01:18:29,600 --> 01:18:32,159
move that one up to there roughly let's

2573
01:18:32,159 --> 01:18:34,560
actually snap it

2574
01:18:34,560 --> 01:18:37,679
let's do this all together

2575
01:18:38,320 --> 01:18:42,719
and snap all of these up with uh here

2576
01:18:42,719 --> 01:18:45,040
now it looks like this is just a normal

2577
01:18:45,040 --> 01:18:45,760
mesh here

2578
01:18:45,760 --> 01:18:48,320
but if i try to tab here and move this

2579
01:18:48,320 --> 01:18:50,080
one you can see that it goes all weird

2580
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:51,760
and the best way to fix this one is just

2581
01:18:51,760 --> 01:18:52,080
do

2582
01:18:52,080 --> 01:18:55,199
a for everything m and then

2583
01:18:55,199 --> 01:18:57,840
merge by distance and suddenly six

2584
01:18:57,840 --> 01:18:59,280
vertices were removed and now

2585
01:18:59,280 --> 01:19:00,640
everything's back to normal the other

2586
01:19:00,640 --> 01:19:02,080
thing that we had is that faces are

2587
01:19:02,080 --> 01:19:03,440
facing the wrong direction

2588
01:19:03,440 --> 01:19:05,120
so remember if you have something that

2589
01:19:05,120 --> 01:19:06,719
looks like a gap but there's actually a

2590
01:19:06,719 --> 01:19:07,360
face here

2591
01:19:07,360 --> 01:19:11,199
you could either do alt n to flip it

2592
01:19:11,199 --> 01:19:13,040
or you can do it for the whole mesh and

2593
01:19:13,040 --> 01:19:14,239
do everything

2594
01:19:14,239 --> 01:19:16,800
alt n and recalculate outside that will

2595
01:19:16,800 --> 01:19:18,239
usually fix that one then you have the

2596
01:19:18,239 --> 01:19:20,560
misaligned vertices like this

2597
01:19:20,560 --> 01:19:22,239
you wanted to have those aligned

2598
01:19:22,239 --> 01:19:24,640
remember make sure that vertex snapping

2599
01:19:24,640 --> 01:19:25,840
is on

2600
01:19:25,840 --> 01:19:27,920
move it on this axis hold the control

2601
01:19:27,920 --> 01:19:29,840
key and snap these

2602
01:19:29,840 --> 01:19:32,400
into edge same for the height and the

2603
01:19:32,400 --> 01:19:33,760
width you could do

2604
01:19:33,760 --> 01:19:36,480
control snap it ctrl snap it height wise

2605
01:19:36,480 --> 01:19:37,280
to that one

2606
01:19:37,280 --> 01:19:39,199
and height wise to that one so that's

2607
01:19:39,199 --> 01:19:40,880
one way to really align everything back

2608
01:19:40,880 --> 01:19:41,679
into shape

2609
01:19:41,679 --> 01:19:43,920
if in setting is behaving really strange

2610
01:19:43,920 --> 01:19:45,440
for you let's say we wanted to inset

2611
01:19:45,440 --> 01:19:46,320
this one

2612
01:19:46,320 --> 01:19:49,440
like this eye to inset if for some

2613
01:19:49,440 --> 01:19:50,640
reason you have

2614
01:19:50,640 --> 01:19:53,440
accidentally scaled your objects outside

2615
01:19:53,440 --> 01:19:55,120
of edit mode let's say you're in object

2616
01:19:55,120 --> 01:19:55,520
mode

2617
01:19:55,520 --> 01:19:58,719
you scale your object along the x-axis

2618
01:19:58,719 --> 01:20:02,000
or let's do the y-axis like this now

2619
01:20:02,000 --> 01:20:03,840
if you look here on the item you can see

2620
01:20:03,840 --> 01:20:05,840
that the scale here is

2621
01:20:05,840 --> 01:20:09,040
string it's not 1 1 1. so now if i try

2622
01:20:09,040 --> 01:20:10,000
to inset this one

2623
01:20:10,000 --> 01:20:12,000
it's not scaling it uniformly it's

2624
01:20:12,000 --> 01:20:13,760
scaling a lot more on the y

2625
01:20:13,760 --> 01:20:15,760
axis and that's because this y axis

2626
01:20:15,760 --> 01:20:16,800
scale is more

2627
01:20:16,800 --> 01:20:18,960
and to fix that you have to just select

2628
01:20:18,960 --> 01:20:20,560
the object in object mode

2629
01:20:20,560 --> 01:20:23,760
click control a and apply scale and that

2630
01:20:23,760 --> 01:20:25,520
brings it back the scale to 1 1

2631
01:20:25,520 --> 01:20:27,440
1 and then i to insert now you can see

2632
01:20:27,440 --> 01:20:29,120
that the insetting is working correctly

2633
01:20:29,120 --> 01:20:30,639
let's say you wanted to work on this

2634
01:20:30,639 --> 01:20:31,520
vertex here

2635
01:20:31,520 --> 01:20:33,440
but when you rotate you're not really

2636
01:20:33,440 --> 01:20:34,960
rotating around that vertex

2637
01:20:34,960 --> 01:20:37,120
just press delete on the keypad or the

2638
01:20:37,120 --> 01:20:38,480
period or the comma key

2639
01:20:38,480 --> 01:20:40,400
and that'll recenter everything you

2640
01:20:40,400 --> 01:20:42,320
scroll out again and now when you rotate

2641
01:20:42,320 --> 01:20:44,320
you'll work nicely around that object so

2642
01:20:44,320 --> 01:20:46,320
it frames it to that object

2643
01:20:46,320 --> 01:20:47,920
another thing that you might run into is

2644
01:20:47,920 --> 01:20:49,679
if you add the subdivision modifier by

2645
01:20:49,679 --> 01:20:50,639
pressing ctrl

2646
01:20:50,639 --> 01:20:52,400
3 for example and everything looks too

2647
01:20:52,400 --> 01:20:54,320
round let's say you wanted the base not

2648
01:20:54,320 --> 01:20:55,679
to be rounded

2649
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:58,000
ctrl z out of that one then you could

2650
01:20:58,000 --> 01:20:58,960
press ctrl

2651
01:20:58,960 --> 01:21:01,120
r in edit mode here add a loop cut quite

2652
01:21:01,120 --> 01:21:02,400
close to the base

2653
01:21:02,400 --> 01:21:04,480
so it's doubled up here and now if i tap

2654
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,239
out of it into object mode and press

2655
01:21:06,239 --> 01:21:08,239
ctrl 2 again then you can see that

2656
01:21:08,239 --> 01:21:10,800
it kept a nice solid edge around the

2657
01:21:10,800 --> 01:21:12,320
bottom here so that's one way to get

2658
01:21:12,320 --> 01:21:13,760
around if you want to keep some edges

2659
01:21:13,760 --> 01:21:14,000
when

2660
01:21:14,000 --> 01:21:15,920
you subdivide it the other thing that we

2661
01:21:15,920 --> 01:21:18,080
had remember when we did the center line

2662
01:21:18,080 --> 01:21:20,639
when we subdivided for example for a car

2663
01:21:20,639 --> 01:21:21,199
window

2664
01:21:21,199 --> 01:21:23,120
or something like that if you have

2665
01:21:23,120 --> 01:21:24,800
mirror modifier on and the inset

2666
01:21:24,800 --> 01:21:26,400
produces a face in the center that you

2667
01:21:26,400 --> 01:21:26,960
don't want

2668
01:21:26,960 --> 01:21:29,760
make sure you press b for boundary and

2669
01:21:29,760 --> 01:21:31,040
that'll remove that little

2670
01:21:31,040 --> 01:21:33,120
center face for you and if b doesn't

2671
01:21:33,120 --> 01:21:34,960
work it's because you have individual

2672
01:21:34,960 --> 01:21:36,159
faces on so press

2673
01:21:36,159 --> 01:21:38,400
i again first to disable individual

2674
01:21:38,400 --> 01:21:39,280
faces and then

2675
01:21:39,280 --> 01:21:41,040
b for boundary should work again all

2676
01:21:41,040 --> 01:21:42,480
right guys so that sums up

2677
01:21:42,480 --> 01:21:43,840
it was a long video and a lot of

2678
01:21:43,840 --> 01:21:45,520
information but it's pretty much

2679
01:21:45,520 --> 01:21:47,120
everything that i do when i low poly

2680
01:21:47,120 --> 01:21:48,719
model stuff this is what i've learned

2681
01:21:48,719 --> 01:21:50,400
over the course of the last four to five

2682
01:21:50,400 --> 01:21:52,080
years that i've been using blender

2683
01:21:52,080 --> 01:21:54,480
i used a bit of 3ds max before that but

2684
01:21:54,480 --> 01:21:56,239
not really at a serious level

2685
01:21:56,239 --> 01:21:58,560
but i think it's mostly the two most

2686
01:21:58,560 --> 01:22:00,080
recent years that i've done on a lot of

2687
01:22:00,080 --> 01:22:02,159
low poly stuff and especially this year

2688
01:22:02,159 --> 01:22:04,000
with my 10 minute modeling challenge i'm

2689
01:22:04,000 --> 01:22:05,760
really trying to find the most efficient

2690
01:22:05,760 --> 01:22:06,400
workflows

2691
01:22:06,400 --> 01:22:08,400
and good fast techniques to do low poly

2692
01:22:08,400 --> 01:22:09,920
modelling come back to the video

2693
01:22:09,920 --> 01:22:11,760
re-watch certain parts

2694
01:22:11,760 --> 01:22:14,639
break it down practice practice practice

2695
01:22:14,639 --> 01:22:16,639
make a lot of low poly stuff i do that

2696
01:22:16,639 --> 01:22:18,080
all the time i basically jump into

2697
01:22:18,080 --> 01:22:19,199
blender and i just

2698
01:22:19,199 --> 01:22:21,440
model anything i can think of houses

2699
01:22:21,440 --> 01:22:22,400
islands

2700
01:22:22,400 --> 01:22:25,040
cars dragons i haven't even covered in

2701
01:22:25,040 --> 01:22:26,239
this video i haven't covered so much

2702
01:22:26,239 --> 01:22:27,600
about character modelling

2703
01:22:27,600 --> 01:22:29,760
same technique applies but when it comes

2704
01:22:29,760 --> 01:22:30,800
to rigging it'll be

2705
01:22:30,800 --> 01:22:32,960
a few more things and animating those i

2706
01:22:32,960 --> 01:22:34,480
should make some videos about that

2707
01:22:34,480 --> 01:22:35,920
so thanks a lot guys for sticking with

2708
01:22:35,920 --> 01:22:37,520
