1
00:00:00,030 --> 00:00:02,040
right folks just getting set up here

2
00:00:02,040 --> 00:00:03,840
ready to do another ten minute modeling

3
00:00:03,840 --> 00:00:06,210
challenge my camera wobbles a little bit

4
00:00:06,210 --> 00:00:07,740
I have to just get that change so I've

5
00:00:07,740 --> 00:00:09,570
got the camera mounted on a microphone

6
00:00:09,570 --> 00:00:11,400
stand that's attached to the table and I

7
00:00:11,400 --> 00:00:12,900
thought that was super clever first

8
00:00:12,900 --> 00:00:14,519
because it's like a one of those pivot

9
00:00:14,519 --> 00:00:16,980
arms that moves up and down left and

10
00:00:16,980 --> 00:00:17,460
right

11
00:00:17,460 --> 00:00:20,490
really smooth nice apart from that it

12
00:00:20,490 --> 00:00:22,769
wobbles like crazy so every time I touch

13
00:00:22,769 --> 00:00:24,720
the table it wobbles I need to change my

14
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:26,699
set up a little bit so pardon for the

15
00:00:26,699 --> 00:00:28,439
wobbly Ness hope you're all doing good

16
00:00:28,439 --> 00:00:30,689
by the way and it's a stressful time I

17
00:00:30,689 --> 00:00:32,009
know but we'll get through it

18
00:00:32,009 --> 00:00:33,960
we'll make some blender stuff make some

19
00:00:33,960 --> 00:00:36,090
unity make some games stay inside

20
00:00:36,090 --> 00:00:37,739
just don't let it stop you from having

21
00:00:37,739 --> 00:00:41,040
fun at least hello everyone and welcome

22
00:00:41,040 --> 00:00:43,079
back it's Thursday again and we're gonna

23
00:00:43,079 --> 00:00:45,480
do another 10-minute build I'm excited

24
00:00:45,480 --> 00:00:47,730
it's episode 15 already the years flying

25
00:00:47,730 --> 00:00:50,370
past thrilled about all the visitors to

26
00:00:50,370 --> 00:00:53,399
my channel I'm actually ecstatic it's

27
00:00:53,399 --> 00:00:55,469
gone way beyond my expectations and I'm

28
00:00:55,469 --> 00:00:57,239
think I'm about to pass 40,000

29
00:00:57,239 --> 00:00:58,980
subscribers which is insane because I

30
00:00:58,980 --> 00:01:00,870
was only a tenth while only on 10,000 I

31
00:01:00,870 --> 00:01:04,290
was ecstatic about 10,000 there's about

32
00:01:04,290 --> 00:01:06,240
only a few weeks ago or a month and a

33
00:01:06,240 --> 00:01:08,640
half now so like Rylander so I've also

34
00:01:08,640 --> 00:01:10,229
started another series if you haven't

35
00:01:10,229 --> 00:01:11,729
seen that one check it out as well I'm

36
00:01:11,729 --> 00:01:13,680
doing a little low-poly racing game

37
00:01:13,680 --> 00:01:15,780
since I don't really have the time for

38
00:01:15,780 --> 00:01:17,640
it because the editing takes quite a

39
00:01:17,640 --> 00:01:19,560
long time but luckily enough I get away

40
00:01:19,560 --> 00:01:21,540
with not sleeping too much so I spend

41
00:01:21,540 --> 00:01:23,400
some late nights doing this during the

42
00:01:23,400 --> 00:01:25,350
days I'm working with an RTS game with a

43
00:01:25,350 --> 00:01:26,759
friend of mine I've said a few times

44
00:01:26,759 --> 00:01:28,590
before we're having a lot of fun it's

45
00:01:28,590 --> 00:01:30,450
going really well it's a lot of work a

46
00:01:30,450 --> 00:01:32,520
lot of hard Quarry development stuff

47
00:01:32,520 --> 00:01:34,350
when it comes to multiplayer and getting

48
00:01:34,350 --> 00:01:36,060
all the units and everything working out

49
00:01:36,060 --> 00:01:38,159
for having a blast and we're in an

50
00:01:38,159 --> 00:01:39,630
exciting stage now where we're gonna

51
00:01:39,630 --> 00:01:41,430
move forward not just with the

52
00:01:41,430 --> 00:01:43,170
development but with a business side of

53
00:01:43,170 --> 00:01:45,450
things as well so my days are filled up

54
00:01:45,450 --> 00:01:47,399
with making the RTS games and my

55
00:01:47,399 --> 00:01:49,140
evenings are full of playing with kids

56
00:01:49,140 --> 00:01:51,630
and I have to try to do the recording of

57
00:01:51,630 --> 00:01:53,310
unity and blender stuff in the nights

58
00:01:53,310 --> 00:01:55,860
and also the editing it's a lot of work

59
00:01:55,860 --> 00:01:57,810
but I'm enjoying it having a lot of fun

60
00:01:57,810 --> 00:02:00,719
last summer I bought a set of Warhammer

61
00:02:00,719 --> 00:02:03,659
40k I think it's called some units we

62
00:02:03,659 --> 00:02:05,340
started to put those together but it's

63
00:02:05,340 --> 00:02:06,960
been on the shelf for quite some time so

64
00:02:06,960 --> 00:02:09,300
today after work I spent some time with

65
00:02:09,300 --> 00:02:11,580
the kids we assembled some new ones and

66
00:02:11,580 --> 00:02:13,319
started to you have to glue them

67
00:02:13,319 --> 00:02:13,800
together

68
00:02:13,800 --> 00:02:15,300
Stockton you don't snap them together

69
00:02:15,300 --> 00:02:16,470
you have to glue their little bits

70
00:02:16,470 --> 00:02:17,970
together we don't really play the game

71
00:02:17,970 --> 00:02:20,460
as such yet but it's a lot of fun just

72
00:02:20,460 --> 00:02:22,590
painting paint in those units so here

73
00:02:22,590 --> 00:02:24,240
are a few sample clips from what would

74
00:02:24,240 --> 00:02:25,290
come up with so far

75
00:02:25,290 --> 00:02:27,510
my son Aiden spent probably two hours on

76
00:02:27,510 --> 00:02:29,700
two of those center units now so he's

77
00:02:29,700 --> 00:02:31,050
really enjoying that and so are the

78
00:02:31,050 --> 00:02:32,610
girls as well we're all that all of us

79
00:02:32,610 --> 00:02:34,350
are doing it together so we're having a

80
00:02:34,350 --> 00:02:34,740
good time

81
00:02:34,740 --> 00:02:37,020
and trying to find stuff if you I've got

82
00:02:37,020 --> 00:02:39,600
stuff stashed away in shelves or in the

83
00:02:39,600 --> 00:02:41,940
attic or in boxes or in a drawer it may

84
00:02:41,940 --> 00:02:43,410
be that your reinvent having some fun

85
00:02:43,410 --> 00:02:45,240
without doing these days thanks for all

86
00:02:45,240 --> 00:02:46,740
the comments so far I've got a lot of

87
00:02:46,740 --> 00:02:48,390
suggestions still but this week I'm

88
00:02:48,390 --> 00:02:50,580
gonna go on a little suggestion that my

89
00:02:50,580 --> 00:02:52,950
son had so he wants me to model a

90
00:02:52,950 --> 00:02:55,440
skyscraper or yeah that's Kai scraper so

91
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:56,670
that's what I'm gonna try to do today

92
00:02:56,670 --> 00:02:59,070
and let's just have some fun make a tall

93
00:02:59,070 --> 00:03:00,780
skyscraper and see what we can put on it

94
00:03:00,780 --> 00:03:02,130
don't even know what its gonna look like

95
00:03:02,130 --> 00:03:04,050
at school we'll figure it out check out

96
00:03:04,050 --> 00:03:05,400
in the description if you want to see my

97
00:03:05,400 --> 00:03:07,140
blender setup video it'll tell you how

98
00:03:07,140 --> 00:03:08,850
to get this pallets on the left and also

99
00:03:08,850 --> 00:03:10,860
how to get this shader view with the

100
00:03:10,860 --> 00:03:13,020
workbench render so you can get the

101
00:03:13,020 --> 00:03:14,580
cavity settings so check that out check

102
00:03:14,580 --> 00:03:16,260
the video in the description all right

103
00:03:16,260 --> 00:03:18,180
with that said let's get cracking I've

104
00:03:18,180 --> 00:03:21,390
spoke way too much go and we are off

105
00:03:21,390 --> 00:03:23,910
it's ticking so tab into edit mode hold

106
00:03:23,910 --> 00:03:25,860
the control key and move this one up to

107
00:03:25,860 --> 00:03:28,410
there a to select everything scale shift

108
00:03:28,410 --> 00:03:31,050
Z let's scale this out and we're not

109
00:03:31,050 --> 00:03:32,640
gonna make it to true scale let's

110
00:03:32,640 --> 00:03:34,709
extrude this one just random extrude

111
00:03:34,709 --> 00:03:37,230
that one e to extrude it extrude again

112
00:03:37,230 --> 00:03:40,260
whatever let's just make some shapes it

113
00:03:40,260 --> 00:03:43,200
e to extrude it someone said that I

114
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,820
should make a t-shirt with this so I'm

115
00:03:44,820 --> 00:03:46,230
probably gonna do that one day I'm gonna

116
00:03:46,230 --> 00:03:48,540
make a t-shirt with e to extrude s to

117
00:03:48,540 --> 00:03:50,760
scale would you buy that merch I'm not

118
00:03:50,760 --> 00:03:51,240
happy with that

119
00:03:51,240 --> 00:03:55,140
let's controls that one okay let's

120
00:03:55,140 --> 00:03:58,530
expand that again expand this e to

121
00:03:58,530 --> 00:04:01,470
extrude e to extrude now maybe we can

122
00:04:01,470 --> 00:04:04,590
put some nice shape here I'm not sure if

123
00:04:04,590 --> 00:04:06,480
I'm gonna be inspired by something in

124
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:10,020
real life but to to edge select Oh to

125
00:04:10,020 --> 00:04:11,790
enable proportional editing

126
00:04:11,790 --> 00:04:16,140
G to move it and G X actually on a

127
00:04:16,140 --> 00:04:18,410
scroll the mouse wheel down a little bit

128
00:04:18,410 --> 00:04:20,600
got some weird behavior there was all

129
00:04:20,600 --> 00:04:24,350
that about see it's Ollie it's on random

130
00:04:24,350 --> 00:04:26,690
that's good don't want it on smooth so

131
00:04:26,690 --> 00:04:28,160
make sure you keep it on smooth if you

132
00:04:28,160 --> 00:04:31,550
want it not to be random so X let's move

133
00:04:31,550 --> 00:04:35,030
this one out to maybe there so let's see

134
00:04:35,030 --> 00:04:36,560
if we can figure out what what this

135
00:04:36,560 --> 00:04:38,690
building could look like maybe that one

136
00:04:38,690 --> 00:04:43,790
G X move out and that's this one oh

137
00:04:43,790 --> 00:04:44,990
that's okay

138
00:04:44,990 --> 00:04:47,360
seven on the keypad top view eight is an

139
00:04:47,360 --> 00:04:50,270
active note b2 box select and then let's

140
00:04:50,270 --> 00:04:53,510
see we've got all the top phases so just

141
00:04:53,510 --> 00:04:55,640
move those up a bit we take a

142
00:04:55,640 --> 00:04:57,920
proportional way off there move it up to

143
00:04:57,920 --> 00:05:01,220
there e to extrude again pi/2 insects

144
00:05:01,220 --> 00:05:04,490
eat extrude let's just tick off some

145
00:05:04,490 --> 00:05:06,290
things here now actually and we'll just

146
00:05:06,290 --> 00:05:09,440
save some lower parts here this can come

147
00:05:09,440 --> 00:05:11,270
up with us still actually but we'll take

148
00:05:11,270 --> 00:05:13,760
that away and then e to extrude no

149
00:05:13,760 --> 00:05:15,920
actually controls at the height inside

150
00:05:15,920 --> 00:05:20,120
this e to extrude it and let's take a

151
00:05:20,120 --> 00:05:22,040
few things off here so hold the shift

152
00:05:22,040 --> 00:05:24,620
key and just deselect a few things I to

153
00:05:24,620 --> 00:05:28,760
inset actually lets controls that arm

154
00:05:28,760 --> 00:05:31,820
and just take these off as well I to

155
00:05:31,820 --> 00:05:36,080
insert this I pressed elements by by

156
00:05:36,080 --> 00:05:38,870
mistake right in sets e to extrude here

157
00:05:38,870 --> 00:05:40,550
we go let's make that a little bit

158
00:05:40,550 --> 00:05:43,160
higher oh it's meant to be a skyscraper

159
00:05:43,160 --> 00:05:46,610
I have to go way taller than that okay I

160
00:05:46,610 --> 00:05:49,070
to insert this we've got some stuff

161
00:05:49,070 --> 00:05:50,270
going on there in the corner so let's

162
00:05:50,270 --> 00:05:52,850
redo that on take away the edge here

163
00:05:52,850 --> 00:05:54,530
it's a bit too picky actually we can

164
00:05:54,530 --> 00:05:55,940
move this one in by selecting these

165
00:05:55,940 --> 00:05:58,400
edges here shift come and then G twice

166
00:05:58,400 --> 00:06:01,010
and that'll force the movement to the

167
00:06:01,010 --> 00:06:05,780
edge so he doesn't go astray then we can

168
00:06:05,780 --> 00:06:08,300
shift select a few of these again let's

169
00:06:08,300 --> 00:06:09,770
make some terrorist type of things here

170
00:06:09,770 --> 00:06:15,080
so I to inset this e to extrude that

171
00:06:15,080 --> 00:06:17,630
here we'll make a terrace so I to insert

172
00:06:17,630 --> 00:06:19,010
this one e to extrude that one down

173
00:06:19,010 --> 00:06:20,180
let's make one here as well a double

174
00:06:20,180 --> 00:06:23,870
terrace it's not really observatory

175
00:06:23,870 --> 00:06:26,000
heights these floors I don't think so

176
00:06:26,000 --> 00:06:28,270
let's put a swimming pool on this one

177
00:06:28,270 --> 00:06:30,700
it can be here maybe in the center

178
00:06:30,700 --> 00:06:34,990
heighten sets he takes good height in

179
00:06:34,990 --> 00:06:37,360
sets Ito extrude it down and let's put

180
00:06:37,360 --> 00:06:39,010
some water here G on the left side and

181
00:06:39,010 --> 00:06:41,890
move that on to some water color let's

182
00:06:41,890 --> 00:06:43,930
put a deck in here height in set that on

183
00:06:43,930 --> 00:06:46,390
e to extrude this one make a wood color

184
00:06:46,390 --> 00:06:48,850
deck here and then here's a bar or

185
00:06:48,850 --> 00:06:50,160
something like that so let's set up that

186
00:06:50,160 --> 00:06:52,840
height in set e to extrude e to extrude

187
00:06:52,840 --> 00:06:55,770
again as to scale it out e to extrude

188
00:06:55,770 --> 00:07:00,280
ITIN set and B to extrude it down okay

189
00:07:00,280 --> 00:07:03,430
and let's continue up it's meant to be a

190
00:07:03,430 --> 00:07:05,230
skyscraper after all so we have to

191
00:07:05,230 --> 00:07:08,320
select a few more things here let's just

192
00:07:08,320 --> 00:07:12,430
go wild here we can select these all of

193
00:07:12,430 --> 00:07:14,830
those right in set that e to extrude

194
00:07:14,830 --> 00:07:18,390
that and that can stay there for now

195
00:07:18,390 --> 00:07:22,120
let's select its lease leave that on on

196
00:07:22,120 --> 00:07:24,250
the side there so that's gonna be

197
00:07:24,250 --> 00:07:27,820
another terrace e to extrude this o itin

198
00:07:27,820 --> 00:07:30,280
sets each extrude up to here and then

199
00:07:30,280 --> 00:07:33,190
here here we can just go right in sets

200
00:07:33,190 --> 00:07:35,320
and make another little back in there

201
00:07:35,320 --> 00:07:38,080
something like that let's go here for

202
00:07:38,080 --> 00:07:40,720
some weird shape now we can do maybe

203
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,210
keep this shape that'll be a bit a bit

204
00:07:43,210 --> 00:07:47,700
wider so I tend set e to extrude and

205
00:07:47,700 --> 00:07:50,620
here what should we do here we need to

206
00:07:50,620 --> 00:07:51,910
go way high over this one as well don't

207
00:07:51,910 --> 00:07:56,920
me okay I didn't set this one I'm

208
00:07:56,920 --> 00:07:59,860
certainly a skyscraper architect it's

209
00:07:59,860 --> 00:08:01,630
probably not the fanciest skyscraper in

210
00:08:01,630 --> 00:08:03,940
the world oh it's the time 518 ok I

211
00:08:03,940 --> 00:08:05,980
should be alright we just kind of put

212
00:08:05,980 --> 00:08:07,270
some windows on this thing as well so

213
00:08:07,270 --> 00:08:11,170
let's move take to press key twice

214
00:08:11,170 --> 00:08:13,790
move this one into here

215
00:08:13,790 --> 00:08:17,120
if I press G twice it moves it along the

216
00:08:17,120 --> 00:08:18,980
current edge so you don't mess up that

217
00:08:18,980 --> 00:08:22,340
geometry okay let's put a bigger inset

218
00:08:22,340 --> 00:08:25,250
here or it let's put here's like some

219
00:08:25,250 --> 00:08:27,010
sort of our first absorb Atari

220
00:08:27,010 --> 00:08:29,420
Observatory dick yeah so that's a bit

221
00:08:29,420 --> 00:08:32,780
bigger so that's where the people that

222
00:08:32,780 --> 00:08:34,520
don't pay as much will go but for the

223
00:08:34,520 --> 00:08:35,780
people that have a lot of money will go

224
00:08:35,780 --> 00:08:38,750
up a lot more to the top you need to

225
00:08:38,750 --> 00:08:40,850
extrude that one s to scale it C to

226
00:08:40,850 --> 00:08:43,729
extrude extrude again s to scale that

227
00:08:43,729 --> 00:08:45,380
one down need to extrude there's gonna

228
00:08:45,380 --> 00:08:47,270
be quite tall yeah that's good and

229
00:08:47,270 --> 00:08:51,680
here's the fancy X is e to extrude and C

230
00:08:51,680 --> 00:08:53,870
s to scale it out here is that fancy

231
00:08:53,870 --> 00:08:58,250
deck note e to extrude this one I to

232
00:08:58,250 --> 00:09:01,570
insert this one e to extrude it down and

233
00:09:01,570 --> 00:09:03,910
here it's like something sort of up

234
00:09:03,910 --> 00:09:08,000
let's see I have to move this one out

235
00:09:08,000 --> 00:09:10,460
again here G twice so we move it along

236
00:09:10,460 --> 00:09:13,220
that edge so we don't get so close to

237
00:09:13,220 --> 00:09:15,890
the edge I tense the intercept that one

238
00:09:15,890 --> 00:09:18,440
e to extrude these these guys get a roof

239
00:09:18,440 --> 00:09:20,390
here as well it's how much they pay to

240
00:09:20,390 --> 00:09:24,320
get up here so they protect it from the

241
00:09:24,320 --> 00:09:28,160
rain probably not from lightning oh yeah

242
00:09:28,160 --> 00:09:30,850
they have lightning protectors something

243
00:09:30,850 --> 00:09:34,070
okay II need to extrude s to scale I'm

244
00:09:34,070 --> 00:09:35,720
wasting too much time that's the scale e

245
00:09:35,720 --> 00:09:37,550
to extrude s to scale eat extra s to

246
00:09:37,550 --> 00:09:40,370
scale its extrude s to scale e to

247
00:09:40,370 --> 00:09:43,520
extrude s to scale it's it's true as the

248
00:09:43,520 --> 00:09:46,340
scale it down a lot okay so I've got 335

249
00:09:46,340 --> 00:09:48,170
now just kind of put a lot of here let's

250
00:09:48,170 --> 00:09:50,660
put a glass alt and select this ring

251
00:09:50,660 --> 00:09:52,910
select clear e to extrude this one ctrl

252
00:09:52,910 --> 00:09:55,490
+ G on the left side and colorized that

253
00:09:55,490 --> 00:09:57,950
to some glass color and now we're gonna

254
00:09:57,950 --> 00:10:00,110
do a whole bunch of random loop cuts

255
00:10:00,110 --> 00:10:01,790
here so ctrl R and use the mouse wheel

256
00:10:01,790 --> 00:10:04,580
just to put a lot of extra different

257
00:10:04,580 --> 00:10:05,960
type of floors we'll have some different

258
00:10:05,960 --> 00:10:09,320
type of windows here so ctrl R scroll

259
00:10:09,320 --> 00:10:12,230
the wheel that will do here's some

260
00:10:12,230 --> 00:10:13,630
taller windows maybe

261
00:10:13,630 --> 00:10:18,240
ctrl R here we go ctrl R

262
00:10:18,240 --> 00:10:22,170
control are upon share as well and that

263
00:10:22,170 --> 00:10:26,160
should be okay and now let's do go to

264
00:10:26,160 --> 00:10:29,160
this actually we we just press three to

265
00:10:29,160 --> 00:10:33,020
go interface select here we got some

266
00:10:33,020 --> 00:10:36,450
this bitters in the behind G twice

267
00:10:36,450 --> 00:10:38,279
because we needed a fairly straight line

268
00:10:38,279 --> 00:10:42,420
here for the windows so probably do it

269
00:10:42,420 --> 00:10:46,290
like G twice to just move it have to do

270
00:10:46,290 --> 00:10:50,310
good enough all right 2:32 so now we're

271
00:10:50,310 --> 00:10:52,110
going to just all select a bunch of

272
00:10:52,110 --> 00:10:54,899
these alt and shift select multiple

273
00:10:54,899 --> 00:10:56,520
things here where we want windows not

274
00:10:56,520 --> 00:10:59,070
there and we don't want them here we can

275
00:10:59,070 --> 00:11:00,630
have a few windows maybe not there but

276
00:11:00,630 --> 00:11:03,480
they're here we want to put controls at

277
00:11:03,480 --> 00:11:08,370
all shift select open shadows and here

278
00:11:08,370 --> 00:11:10,589
as well and here we want windows all the

279
00:11:10,589 --> 00:11:14,279
way along here we want and there as well

280
00:11:14,279 --> 00:11:17,670
let's skip some floors in between and

281
00:11:17,670 --> 00:11:20,010
that's okay and then I to insert twice

282
00:11:20,010 --> 00:11:21,930
now so first time you it does like that

283
00:11:21,930 --> 00:11:24,320
but if you hit I again now you get

284
00:11:24,320 --> 00:11:27,959
individual faces here and then alt e to

285
00:11:27,959 --> 00:11:29,970
extrude along face normals and go in

286
00:11:29,970 --> 00:11:32,160
just a slight bit G on the left side and

287
00:11:32,160 --> 00:11:34,410
make like a blue window type of thing so

288
00:11:34,410 --> 00:11:36,089
now we've got a whole bunch of windows

289
00:11:36,089 --> 00:11:38,640
for the skyscraper got 143 so we can

290
00:11:38,640 --> 00:11:39,990
also colorize it a little bit just to

291
00:11:39,990 --> 00:11:41,880
break up the colors a little bit so

292
00:11:41,880 --> 00:11:44,370
let's say alt selects my alt shift

293
00:11:44,370 --> 00:11:46,170
select a few of these actually we're

294
00:11:46,170 --> 00:11:50,870
going to do yeah this one maybe that one

295
00:11:50,870 --> 00:11:56,520
do that one and this one and this one

296
00:11:56,520 --> 00:11:58,560
and then G and move that to something

297
00:11:58,560 --> 00:12:02,070
darker just it's not too dark maybe that

298
00:12:02,070 --> 00:12:04,380
was too dark so let's go G on the left

299
00:12:04,380 --> 00:12:06,690
side here in the UVs okay that's it so

300
00:12:06,690 --> 00:12:09,810
about 114 now I'm just gonna be do a lot

301
00:12:09,810 --> 00:12:11,640
a few more things here let's put that's

302
00:12:11,640 --> 00:12:14,880
some sort of a grass thing and here's

303
00:12:14,880 --> 00:12:18,450
just I twice to insert that one that's

304
00:12:18,450 --> 00:12:21,070
sort of a utility thing

305
00:12:21,070 --> 00:12:22,750
and then we can expand oh we need some

306
00:12:22,750 --> 00:12:24,790
windows down here as well I guess I'll

307
00:12:24,790 --> 00:12:31,030
select on item sets twice right insert

308
00:12:31,030 --> 00:12:37,180
twice alt eat extra long normals there

309
00:12:37,180 --> 00:12:39,760
we go Angie move it to color forty

310
00:12:39,760 --> 00:12:42,160
seconds so let's just get some stuff

311
00:12:42,160 --> 00:12:49,870
here on the ground there we go some

312
00:12:49,870 --> 00:12:52,390
stuff for the base you here's some sort

313
00:12:52,390 --> 00:12:59,290
of an entrance thing probably so that

314
00:12:59,290 --> 00:13:04,180
can be so 18 seconds to go now we'll

315
00:13:04,180 --> 00:13:07,560
just get a glass frontier

316
00:13:12,910 --> 00:13:19,040
eat extrude that on on four three two

317
00:13:19,040 --> 00:13:22,480
one that's it

318
00:13:22,480 --> 00:13:25,880
I'm not even stressed this time sorry

319
00:13:25,880 --> 00:13:28,790
about pop I apologize I made a habit

320
00:13:28,790 --> 00:13:30,680
some of the later builds to become

321
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,480
really stressful so I'm sorry if we came

322
00:13:32,480 --> 00:13:34,730
here to see me get stressed out every

323
00:13:34,730 --> 00:13:36,800
now and then I should probably just go a

324
00:13:36,800 --> 00:13:38,269
little bit easier so I don't have to

325
00:13:38,269 --> 00:13:43,130
flip out like I do sometimes but I will

326
00:13:43,130 --> 00:13:44,750
pressure myself many more times don't

327
00:13:44,750 --> 00:13:46,010
worry about that I've got loads of

328
00:13:46,010 --> 00:13:49,910
thoughts about doing like 10 aircraft or

329
00:13:49,910 --> 00:13:51,980
animals I've got a plan for I've got

330
00:13:51,980 --> 00:13:54,649
weapons I've got so you name it so don't

331
00:13:54,649 --> 00:13:56,420
worry I'm gonna stress myself out in the

332
00:13:56,420 --> 00:13:58,370
future again this one didn't stress out

333
00:13:58,370 --> 00:13:59,720
too much so there we have it

334
00:13:59,720 --> 00:14:02,899
it's a skyscraper it's not an amazing

335
00:14:02,899 --> 00:14:05,660
piece of architecture I hope it's all

336
00:14:05,660 --> 00:14:07,610
right son I don't know if I did you

337
00:14:07,610 --> 00:14:09,949
proud on this one but I tried my best to

338
00:14:09,949 --> 00:14:12,410
not stress out this time and just that

339
00:14:12,410 --> 00:14:14,389
have a little casual modelling session

340
00:14:14,389 --> 00:14:16,190
here every now and then it would be nice

341
00:14:16,190 --> 00:14:18,529
to do a few of those as well so and I

342
00:14:18,529 --> 00:14:20,690
realize here I didn't put any fencing

343
00:14:20,690 --> 00:14:23,269
for the poor economy view deck here so

344
00:14:23,269 --> 00:14:24,620
we're gonna have some casualties here

345
00:14:24,620 --> 00:14:26,000
we're gonna have some people blowing off

346
00:14:26,000 --> 00:14:28,070
the sides here they should have paid for

347
00:14:28,070 --> 00:14:29,420
the top floors they've got some nice

348
00:14:29,420 --> 00:14:31,399
protective glass there so keep that in

349
00:14:31,399 --> 00:14:34,490
mind go to the top if you can I should

350
00:14:34,490 --> 00:14:36,110
also mention that I got a lot of

351
00:14:36,110 --> 00:14:37,550
comments and I don't know if I deserve

352
00:14:37,550 --> 00:14:40,670
so many nice praises because I don't say

353
00:14:40,670 --> 00:14:42,560
I just do these things to practice my

354
00:14:42,560 --> 00:14:44,000
own modeling skills I'm not trying to

355
00:14:44,000 --> 00:14:46,610
show off I'm not trying to do the most

356
00:14:46,610 --> 00:14:48,140
amazing builds that you can in ten

357
00:14:48,140 --> 00:14:49,760
minutes it's just a personal challenge

358
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,890
that I invite other people to watch and

359
00:14:51,890 --> 00:14:53,390
hopefully learn from I'm really happy

360
00:14:53,390 --> 00:14:55,190
that people can see it as tutorials it

361
00:14:55,190 --> 00:14:57,260
wasn't designed to be tutorials it was

362
00:14:57,260 --> 00:14:59,329
just me having fun doing some some

363
00:14:59,329 --> 00:15:00,920
challenges and the fact that people

364
00:15:00,920 --> 00:15:03,319
learn from it is just an extreme bonus

365
00:15:03,319 --> 00:15:05,930
and I'm really happy about that but I'm

366
00:15:05,930 --> 00:15:08,120
not gonna be able to push myself to to

367
00:15:08,120 --> 00:15:09,620
better myself every time I've realized

368
00:15:09,620 --> 00:15:11,120
that I'm not gonna put that pressure on

369
00:15:11,120 --> 00:15:13,130
myself either it's stressful enough as

370
00:15:13,130 --> 00:15:14,510
it is trying to fit these modelling

371
00:15:14,510 --> 00:15:16,370
challenges in every week so I'll do my

372
00:15:16,370 --> 00:15:18,500
best to to just that keep it all the

373
00:15:18,500 --> 00:15:20,540
casual look every now and then I'll

374
00:15:20,540 --> 00:15:22,399
probably freak out and stress myself out

375
00:15:22,399 --> 00:15:24,270
like I did with the cars

376
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:27,000
I get a message at 1:30 in the morning

377
00:15:27,000 --> 00:15:31,440
who is this it's my friend Jim if you're

378
00:15:31,440 --> 00:15:33,450
in the chat Jim you shouldn't be texting

379
00:15:33,450 --> 00:15:35,070
me this time well you should you can

380
00:15:35,070 --> 00:15:36,540
text me anytime because I should just

381
00:15:36,540 --> 00:15:38,100
mute my phone it's my own fault

382
00:15:38,100 --> 00:15:40,230
so I'll have a look at that later Jim if

383
00:15:40,230 --> 00:15:41,760
you're in the chat today and during the

384
00:15:41,760 --> 00:15:43,560
premiere you were here last week so nice

385
00:15:43,560 --> 00:15:45,030
to see you it's been a long time since

386
00:15:45,030 --> 00:15:47,250
we met Jim's a good friend of mine we

387
00:15:47,250 --> 00:15:49,170
grew up together we've haven't seen each

388
00:15:49,170 --> 00:15:50,820
other in a while mostly because I've got

389
00:15:50,820 --> 00:15:52,650
way too many things sort that I think I

390
00:15:52,650 --> 00:15:54,600
need to do but I should prioritize and

391
00:15:54,600 --> 00:15:56,490
go and visit him again but I have to

392
00:15:56,490 --> 00:15:58,470
wait until this quarantine thing goes

393
00:15:58,470 --> 00:16:00,390
out so maybe in a few months or

394
00:16:00,390 --> 00:16:01,680
something like that well fingers crossed

395
00:16:01,680 --> 00:16:03,590
we can see what goes on

396
00:16:03,590 --> 00:16:05,940
