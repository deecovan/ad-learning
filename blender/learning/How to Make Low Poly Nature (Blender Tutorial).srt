1
00:00:00,080 --> 00:00:01,439
so i've been getting some tutorial

2
00:00:01,439 --> 00:00:03,439
requests to make some more low poly

3
00:00:03,439 --> 00:00:05,359
blender tutorials and so i decided to

4
00:00:05,359 --> 00:00:07,440
make a tutorial on how to make low poly

5
00:00:07,440 --> 00:00:09,920
nature in blender so in this tutorial

6
00:00:09,920 --> 00:00:11,200
we're going to be making all of these

7
00:00:11,200 --> 00:00:12,719
different nature assets and if you'd

8
00:00:12,719 --> 00:00:14,320
just like to follow a certain part and

9
00:00:14,320 --> 00:00:16,239
just model a certain nature asset i'm

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,600
gonna have time stamps in the video

11
00:00:17,600 --> 00:00:18,880
description so you can just go down

12
00:00:18,880 --> 00:00:21,039
there and click on a timestamp and it'll

13
00:00:21,039 --> 00:00:22,800
jump you to the part in the video where

14
00:00:22,800 --> 00:00:24,640
i make the asset so we're gonna be

15
00:00:24,640 --> 00:00:26,640
making this low poly mountain with snow

16
00:00:26,640 --> 00:00:28,400
on it we're also gonna be creating this

17
00:00:28,400 --> 00:00:31,119
low poly tree stump and a low poly

18
00:00:31,119 --> 00:00:33,040
wooden log we're also going to be making

19
00:00:33,040 --> 00:00:34,800
these low poly flowers and i'm going to

20
00:00:34,800 --> 00:00:36,640
show you how to make it so that when you

21
00:00:36,640 --> 00:00:39,040
duplicate the flowers the flowers have a

22
00:00:39,040 --> 00:00:40,800
random color and i'm going to show you

23
00:00:40,800 --> 00:00:42,800
how to set up the colors to the colors

24
00:00:42,800 --> 00:00:44,239
that you want we're also going to be

25
00:00:44,239 --> 00:00:46,399
making some low poly rocks and we're

26
00:00:46,399 --> 00:00:48,079
going to be making some low poly grass

27
00:00:48,079 --> 00:00:49,120
this is something that you could use

28
00:00:49,120 --> 00:00:51,039
like a particle system and make the

29
00:00:51,039 --> 00:00:52,960
grass in a scene and we're going to

30
00:00:52,960 --> 00:00:55,440
create some low poly bushes and some

31
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:56,719
different mushrooms so we're going to be

32
00:00:56,719 --> 00:00:58,960
creating some brown mushrooms and also

33
00:00:58,960 --> 00:01:00,559
some of these red mushrooms with the

34
00:01:00,559 --> 00:01:02,480
little white dots on them and i'm going

35
00:01:02,480 --> 00:01:03,920
to be using blender evie for this

36
00:01:03,920 --> 00:01:05,199
tutorial but you could definitely use

37
00:01:05,199 --> 00:01:07,200
cycles i'm just using evie because evie

38
00:01:07,200 --> 00:01:08,720
is a real-time render engine and i think

39
00:01:08,720 --> 00:01:10,880
it looks pretty nice for these low poly

40
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:13,600
nature assets alright so here i am in a

41
00:01:13,600 --> 00:01:15,280
new scene in blender and i've turned the

42
00:01:15,280 --> 00:01:17,200
render engine to eevee and then i've

43
00:01:17,200 --> 00:01:19,200
turned on ambient occlusion screen space

44
00:01:19,200 --> 00:01:21,520
reflections and motion blur and then

45
00:01:21,520 --> 00:01:23,439
also over here on the world settings i

46
00:01:23,439 --> 00:01:26,159
have this whipple creek hdri i just used

47
00:01:26,159 --> 00:01:28,080
the 1k version i'll have the link in the

48
00:01:28,080 --> 00:01:29,200
video description this is from

49
00:01:29,200 --> 00:01:30,880
hdrihaven.com

50
00:01:30,880 --> 00:01:32,720
if you'd like to download this hdri that

51
00:01:32,720 --> 00:01:34,079
i'm using and i'm just using this to get

52
00:01:34,079 --> 00:01:36,240
some really nice lighting for our nature

53
00:01:36,240 --> 00:01:38,320
scene so let's first start off by making

54
00:01:38,320 --> 00:01:39,840
the mountain so to make the mountain i'm

55
00:01:39,840 --> 00:01:41,920
actually going to be using a landscape

56
00:01:41,920 --> 00:01:43,600
blender add-on it's built into blender

57
00:01:43,600 --> 00:01:45,360
so you can enable it by going edit and

58
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,520
going to preferences and then right over

59
00:01:47,520 --> 00:01:49,920
here on the add-ons just start typing in

60
00:01:49,920 --> 00:01:51,360
landscape and you can see there's the

61
00:01:51,360 --> 00:01:54,399
add mesh ant landscape just turn this on

62
00:01:54,399 --> 00:01:55,600
and then if you want it to be in all

63
00:01:55,600 --> 00:01:57,360
your future blender files you can click

64
00:01:57,360 --> 00:01:58,799
on save preferences and then you can

65
00:01:58,799 --> 00:02:00,880
always use it in the future so with that

66
00:02:00,880 --> 00:02:02,560
turned on i'm going to press shift a i'm

67
00:02:02,560 --> 00:02:03,759
going to go to mesh and i'm going to go

68
00:02:03,759 --> 00:02:05,600
all the way down here and click on

69
00:02:05,600 --> 00:02:07,520
landscape you can see it adds a

70
00:02:07,520 --> 00:02:08,878
landscape so this is basically a

71
00:02:08,878 --> 00:02:10,878
landscape generator now there are a

72
00:02:10,878 --> 00:02:12,480
bunch of settings here but there's also

73
00:02:12,480 --> 00:02:14,400
some presets if you click on this you

74
00:02:14,400 --> 00:02:15,440
could see it has a bunch of different

75
00:02:15,440 --> 00:02:17,520
presets you can try these out and use

76
00:02:17,520 --> 00:02:19,120
one that you like i'm going to use

77
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:21,360
mountains 2. so when i click on that it

78
00:02:21,360 --> 00:02:23,040
does look pretty cool but it's not very

79
00:02:23,040 --> 00:02:25,200
high up so to make it bigger i can

80
00:02:25,200 --> 00:02:27,120
scroll down here and there's this height

81
00:02:27,120 --> 00:02:28,560
if i hold down the shift key while

82
00:02:28,560 --> 00:02:30,080
dragging this i can make more sensitive

83
00:02:30,080 --> 00:02:32,080
movements and i can make this a lot

84
00:02:32,080 --> 00:02:33,760
higher so now that we have this mountain

85
00:02:33,760 --> 00:02:35,519
i'm just going to close these settings

86
00:02:35,519 --> 00:02:36,400
right here

87
00:02:36,400 --> 00:02:38,400
and i'm going to tab in edit mode and

88
00:02:38,400 --> 00:02:39,760
you can see what the mountain is looking

89
00:02:39,760 --> 00:02:41,920
like now right now it's smooth and it's

90
00:02:41,920 --> 00:02:43,519
also way too high poly so we're going to

91
00:02:43,519 --> 00:02:45,760
make it look low poly so i'm going to go

92
00:02:45,760 --> 00:02:47,599
back into object mode so instead of this

93
00:02:47,599 --> 00:02:49,120
being shaded smooth i want it to be

94
00:02:49,120 --> 00:02:51,440
shaded flat so you can just shade that

95
00:02:51,440 --> 00:02:53,280
flat and now it definitely looks more

96
00:02:53,280 --> 00:02:54,720
low poly but it's just a bunch of

97
00:02:54,720 --> 00:02:56,000
squares and there's not really any

98
00:02:56,000 --> 00:02:58,159
triangles and it is too high detail so

99
00:02:58,159 --> 00:02:59,599
what i'm going to do is go over here to

100
00:02:59,599 --> 00:03:01,680
the modifiers tab i'm going to click on

101
00:03:01,680 --> 00:03:03,599
add modifier and i'm going to add the

102
00:03:03,599 --> 00:03:05,920
decimate modifier now this ratio here

103
00:03:05,920 --> 00:03:07,599
you can turn this down and what it's

104
00:03:07,599 --> 00:03:08,560
going to do is it's going to start

105
00:03:08,560 --> 00:03:10,400
taking away more and more of the mesh

106
00:03:10,400 --> 00:03:12,159
and you can see now it has a very low

107
00:03:12,159 --> 00:03:14,480
poly look so just get it to how you like

108
00:03:14,480 --> 00:03:16,319
i like something i like that you can see

109
00:03:16,319 --> 00:03:17,680
it has all those little triangles and

110
00:03:17,680 --> 00:03:19,599
stuff in there which i really like so

111
00:03:19,599 --> 00:03:21,120
now that i like that i'm going to move

112
00:03:21,120 --> 00:03:22,959
my mouse over the decimate modifier and

113
00:03:22,959 --> 00:03:25,360
press ctrl a make sure you're in object

114
00:03:25,360 --> 00:03:27,519
mode when you do this ctrl a and that'll

115
00:03:27,519 --> 00:03:29,360
apply it now when i tab in edit mode you

116
00:03:29,360 --> 00:03:31,280
can see it has a lot less vertices and

117
00:03:31,280 --> 00:03:33,360
it has much more of a low poly look so

118
00:03:33,360 --> 00:03:34,720
now i'm going to add some material so

119
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:35,680
i'm going to click over here on the

120
00:03:35,680 --> 00:03:37,760
material tab click on new and i'm going

121
00:03:37,760 --> 00:03:40,239
to call this mountain and for this i'm

122
00:03:40,239 --> 00:03:43,200
just going to make the base color a dark

123
00:03:43,200 --> 00:03:44,879
brown color i'm also going to press z

124
00:03:44,879 --> 00:03:46,640
and move my mouse up to go into rendered

125
00:03:46,640 --> 00:03:48,080
view and you can see what it's looking

126
00:03:48,080 --> 00:03:50,000
like now right now it's a bit too shiny

127
00:03:50,000 --> 00:03:51,519
so i'm going to turn the roughness up a

128
00:03:51,519 --> 00:03:53,040
bit because mountains aren't really that

129
00:03:53,040 --> 00:03:55,200
shiny and then i will also make this

130
00:03:55,200 --> 00:03:56,959
darker and maybe turn the roughness up

131
00:03:56,959 --> 00:03:59,360
just a bit more okay something like that

132
00:03:59,360 --> 00:04:02,480
so now i want to add the snow on the top

133
00:04:02,480 --> 00:04:04,319
of the mountains so what i'm going to do

134
00:04:04,319 --> 00:04:06,159
is tap into edit mode and i just need to

135
00:04:06,159 --> 00:04:08,319
select the top parts where i want the

136
00:04:08,319 --> 00:04:10,159
snow to be so to do that i'm going to

137
00:04:10,159 --> 00:04:12,159
press 3 and that'll go to this face

138
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:13,439
select you can also just click right

139
00:04:13,439 --> 00:04:15,519
here press a to deselect everything and

140
00:04:15,519 --> 00:04:17,600
then i'm going to press 1 to go to front

141
00:04:17,600 --> 00:04:18,959
view actually in this case i'm going to

142
00:04:18,959 --> 00:04:20,720
press 3 to go to side view because i can

143
00:04:20,720 --> 00:04:22,240
see the mountains a little bit better

144
00:04:22,240 --> 00:04:23,919
then i'll press z and move my mouse over

145
00:04:23,919 --> 00:04:26,160
to go into wireframe and now i can press

146
00:04:26,160 --> 00:04:27,840
c and that's going to open up the circle

147
00:04:27,840 --> 00:04:30,240
select and i can just select the little

148
00:04:30,240 --> 00:04:32,720
peaks where i want the snow to be so

149
00:04:32,720 --> 00:04:34,479
there i want a lot of snow to be right

150
00:04:34,479 --> 00:04:36,960
there okay a little bit more here and

151
00:04:36,960 --> 00:04:39,199
now i can just go around here press z

152
00:04:39,199 --> 00:04:41,199
move out to go back into solid view and

153
00:04:41,199 --> 00:04:43,120
i could just box select a few areas by

154
00:04:43,120 --> 00:04:45,120
pressing b for the box select just

155
00:04:45,120 --> 00:04:47,280
selecting a few areas that i want to be

156
00:04:47,280 --> 00:04:48,960
snow maybe in here i want there to be

157
00:04:48,960 --> 00:04:50,639
more snow so i'm gonna just go around

158
00:04:50,639 --> 00:04:53,040
here pressing b for box select just

159
00:04:53,040 --> 00:04:54,800
selecting all the areas that you want

160
00:04:54,800 --> 00:04:57,040
the snow to be on okay let's just go

161
00:04:57,040 --> 00:04:58,479
around here i don't want there to be too

162
00:04:58,479 --> 00:05:01,120
much snow but also not too little snow

163
00:05:01,120 --> 00:05:02,639
all right so once you've selected all

164
00:05:02,639 --> 00:05:04,160
the places that you want the snow to be

165
00:05:04,160 --> 00:05:05,680
i'm going to scroll up here i'm going to

166
00:05:05,680 --> 00:05:08,080
click on the plus and then click on new

167
00:05:08,080 --> 00:05:10,000
and i'm going to call it snow and i'm

168
00:05:10,000 --> 00:05:11,759
just going to leave it at the default

169
00:05:11,759 --> 00:05:12,960
maybe just make it a little bit more

170
00:05:12,960 --> 00:05:14,240
shiny so turn the roughness down a

171
00:05:14,240 --> 00:05:15,600
little bit because snow is somewhat

172
00:05:15,600 --> 00:05:17,600
reflective and then with that selected

173
00:05:17,600 --> 00:05:19,600
i'm going to click assign so now if i go

174
00:05:19,600 --> 00:05:21,199
into rendered mode you can see what it's

175
00:05:21,199 --> 00:05:22,800
looking like so now if you want to go

176
00:05:22,800 --> 00:05:24,240
ahead and change some stuff like maybe

177
00:05:24,240 --> 00:05:25,520
there's a little bit too much snow or

178
00:05:25,520 --> 00:05:27,360
too little you can have an edit mode

179
00:05:27,360 --> 00:05:29,120
just keep on selecting some areas like i

180
00:05:29,120 --> 00:05:31,600
think i might have some snow there um i

181
00:05:31,600 --> 00:05:33,199
think i might connect these so if i just

182
00:05:33,199 --> 00:05:34,800
like box select this maybe go to the

183
00:05:34,800 --> 00:05:36,400
circle select with c

184
00:05:36,400 --> 00:05:38,080
just select some more areas and then

185
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:40,320
with the snow selected click on a sign

186
00:05:40,320 --> 00:05:42,080
now you can see there's more snow and

187
00:05:42,080 --> 00:05:43,280
then also if you're going to have these

188
00:05:43,280 --> 00:05:45,680
mountains as a backdrop behind your low

189
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:47,759
poly scene you could just like scale it

190
00:05:47,759 --> 00:05:50,000
down on the x axis scale it down like

191
00:05:50,000 --> 00:05:51,440
that and then when you're looking at it

192
00:05:51,440 --> 00:05:53,280
from side view it does look a little bit

193
00:05:53,280 --> 00:05:54,720
cooler but when you're looking at it

194
00:05:54,720 --> 00:05:56,080
from the top it does look kind of weird

195
00:05:56,080 --> 00:05:57,680
stretched out so you may not want to do

196
00:05:57,680 --> 00:06:00,000
that it really depends on your scene so

197
00:06:00,000 --> 00:06:01,120
i'm just going to scale it down a little

198
00:06:01,120 --> 00:06:03,680
bit by going s and x scan it down just a

199
00:06:03,680 --> 00:06:04,720
little bit more so it's a little bit

200
00:06:04,720 --> 00:06:06,479
more flatter kind of like a mountain

201
00:06:06,479 --> 00:06:08,639
range just like that and then one last

202
00:06:08,639 --> 00:06:10,479
thing i am going to go into edit mode

203
00:06:10,479 --> 00:06:12,639
press one to go to the vertex select and

204
00:06:12,639 --> 00:06:14,479
just hold down the shift key and select

205
00:06:14,479 --> 00:06:16,080
these four vertices out here and then

206
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:18,319
press x and delete vertices and that way

207
00:06:18,319 --> 00:06:19,520
there's just a circle around the

208
00:06:19,520 --> 00:06:20,960
mountains and i think it makes it look a

209
00:06:20,960 --> 00:06:22,720
little bit nicer so that's going to be

210
00:06:22,720 --> 00:06:24,800
it for my low poly mountains all right

211
00:06:24,800 --> 00:06:26,479
so let's go ahead and do the trees next

212
00:06:26,479 --> 00:06:27,840
now before we do the trees i'm just

213
00:06:27,840 --> 00:06:30,479
going to press shift a add a plane i

214
00:06:30,479 --> 00:06:32,000
will scale this plane down and then

215
00:06:32,000 --> 00:06:34,560
press s and y scale it out a little bit

216
00:06:34,560 --> 00:06:36,240
and then i'm going to hit new and call

217
00:06:36,240 --> 00:06:39,360
this grass just add a grass material and

218
00:06:39,360 --> 00:06:40,560
then on the base color i'm just going to

219
00:06:40,560 --> 00:06:43,280
make it a basic grass material

220
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,000
and go down here turn the roughness up a

221
00:06:46,000 --> 00:06:47,280
bit and that's just going to be our

222
00:06:47,280 --> 00:06:48,560
plane that we're going to have the

223
00:06:48,560 --> 00:06:50,800
nature assets on all right so let's make

224
00:06:50,800 --> 00:06:52,639
the four trees now the first one i'm

225
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,319
going to make is the apple tree or the

226
00:06:54,319 --> 00:06:56,319
fruit tree so i'm going to press shift a

227
00:06:56,319 --> 00:06:58,639
and i'm going to start with a plane just

228
00:06:58,639 --> 00:07:00,560
scale the plane down and just bring it

229
00:07:00,560 --> 00:07:02,240
up by pressing g and z bring it up a

230
00:07:02,240 --> 00:07:03,599
little bit i'm actually going to go out

231
00:07:03,599 --> 00:07:04,880
of rendered mode just so that i can see

232
00:07:04,880 --> 00:07:06,560
it a little bit better okay i'm going to

233
00:07:06,560 --> 00:07:08,720
tab into edit mode and with all of these

234
00:07:08,720 --> 00:07:10,639
selected i'm going to press s

235
00:07:10,639 --> 00:07:12,800
0 and enter so that way we only have one

236
00:07:12,800 --> 00:07:14,960
little vertice right in the middle now

237
00:07:14,960 --> 00:07:17,039
i'm going to press m and that'll merge

238
00:07:17,039 --> 00:07:18,639
it and i'm going to merge by distance

239
00:07:18,639 --> 00:07:19,919
and now it's gotten rid of the extra

240
00:07:19,919 --> 00:07:21,840
vertices and there's just one vertice in

241
00:07:21,840 --> 00:07:23,759
the middle so now i can press 1 to go to

242
00:07:23,759 --> 00:07:25,360
front view and it does look like i

243
00:07:25,360 --> 00:07:26,960
actually modeled this sideways so i'm

244
00:07:26,960 --> 00:07:28,160
just going to press a to select

245
00:07:28,160 --> 00:07:32,240
everything r and z and type in 90

246
00:07:32,240 --> 00:07:34,479
enter now when i press 1 the mountain is

247
00:07:34,479 --> 00:07:36,160
going to be behind us and i think i will

248
00:07:36,160 --> 00:07:37,919
press g and then click with my middle

249
00:07:37,919 --> 00:07:39,360
mouse wheel just move this over a little

250
00:07:39,360 --> 00:07:41,199
bit so just select the tree again i'm

251
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,199
going to press 1 for front view and i

252
00:07:43,199 --> 00:07:45,199
will tab into edit mode and then i can

253
00:07:45,199 --> 00:07:47,759
just extrude that up by pressing e and

254
00:07:47,759 --> 00:07:49,680
i'm basically just going to make the

255
00:07:49,680 --> 00:07:52,000
shape of the tree trunk just going all

256
00:07:52,000 --> 00:07:53,039
the way up here and then i'm going to

257
00:07:53,039 --> 00:07:54,400
have two branches coming out and

258
00:07:54,400 --> 00:07:56,319
connecting up to the tree so i'm going

259
00:07:56,319 --> 00:07:58,800
to select this extrude that out with e

260
00:07:58,800 --> 00:08:00,319
extrude that up just click and place

261
00:08:00,319 --> 00:08:01,360
that and just have it come up we're

262
00:08:01,360 --> 00:08:03,120
going to be having all the leaves up

263
00:08:03,120 --> 00:08:05,680
here and then i think i will press ctrl

264
00:08:05,680 --> 00:08:07,520
r add a loop cut right in there click

265
00:08:07,520 --> 00:08:09,919
and then press g and bring this down and

266
00:08:09,919 --> 00:08:11,919
then i can extrude this up with e and

267
00:08:11,919 --> 00:08:14,400
then e again and just bring that up now

268
00:08:14,400 --> 00:08:15,840
the tree is kind of flat right now so

269
00:08:15,840 --> 00:08:18,319
i'm gonna hold down the shift key select

270
00:08:18,319 --> 00:08:20,960
this branch press seven to go to top

271
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:22,879
view and just press r to rotate that and

272
00:08:22,879 --> 00:08:24,720
just bring it out a little bit and then

273
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:26,160
i could also do that for this branch so

274
00:08:26,160 --> 00:08:28,319
i will click on this and then shift

275
00:08:28,319 --> 00:08:30,000
select this and this one

276
00:08:30,000 --> 00:08:32,559
7 for top view and just press r to

277
00:08:32,559 --> 00:08:34,880
rotate it a little bit press g and move

278
00:08:34,880 --> 00:08:35,919
it over

279
00:08:35,919 --> 00:08:38,320
and now the tree is a little bit more 3d

280
00:08:38,320 --> 00:08:40,080
okay let's tab back into object mode and

281
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:42,159
now i need to add some modifiers to

282
00:08:42,159 --> 00:08:43,919
thicken it up so i'm going to go to the

283
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:45,519
modifiers panel right here and i'm going

284
00:08:45,519 --> 00:08:47,279
to click on add modifier and we're going

285
00:08:47,279 --> 00:08:50,000
to add the skin modifier so when we add

286
00:08:50,000 --> 00:08:51,839
it now it has a lot of thickness but

287
00:08:51,839 --> 00:08:53,440
it's a little bit too thick so i'm going

288
00:08:53,440 --> 00:08:55,519
to tab into edit mode double tap a make

289
00:08:55,519 --> 00:08:57,120
sure everything is selected you can go

290
00:08:57,120 --> 00:08:58,959
into wireframe view just to see if

291
00:08:58,959 --> 00:09:01,040
everything's selected and then i'm going

292
00:09:01,040 --> 00:09:03,120
to press ctrl a

293
00:09:03,120 --> 00:09:06,080
and ctrl a is going to scale how thick

294
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:08,560
that skin is so just scale it down ctrl

295
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:10,560
a make it smaller and then i do want the

296
00:09:10,560 --> 00:09:12,000
trunk to be thicker and then i want the

297
00:09:12,000 --> 00:09:14,320
limbs to be thinner so i will deselect

298
00:09:14,320 --> 00:09:15,279
everything

299
00:09:15,279 --> 00:09:17,040
press z move my mouse over we'll go into

300
00:09:17,040 --> 00:09:19,519
wireframe press b i'm just going to box

301
00:09:19,519 --> 00:09:21,680
select some of the trunk and then i can

302
00:09:21,680 --> 00:09:24,880
press ctrl a make it a bit thicker

303
00:09:24,880 --> 00:09:27,360
and then just box select the bottom here

304
00:09:27,360 --> 00:09:29,600
press ctrl a make it even thicker and

305
00:09:29,600 --> 00:09:30,959
then i think i'll just select this last

306
00:09:30,959 --> 00:09:33,279
one press ctrl a and make it even

307
00:09:33,279 --> 00:09:35,040
thicker so now the tree starts out

308
00:09:35,040 --> 00:09:36,320
really thick and then it gets thinner

309
00:09:36,320 --> 00:09:38,560
and thinner and then right up here i'm

310
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:40,720
going to select this one and this one

311
00:09:40,720 --> 00:09:42,800
press ctrl a make it even smaller

312
00:09:42,800 --> 00:09:44,160
because these are just some branches

313
00:09:44,160 --> 00:09:46,000
coming out and then i think i want the

314
00:09:46,000 --> 00:09:48,080
trunk overall to be a little bit thicker

315
00:09:48,080 --> 00:09:50,800
so i'll just box select the trunk here

316
00:09:50,800 --> 00:09:52,480
press ctrl a make it a little bit

317
00:09:52,480 --> 00:09:54,240
thicker overall

318
00:09:54,240 --> 00:09:56,640
all right there we go so now we have

319
00:09:56,640 --> 00:09:59,839
our low poly trunk and branches so now

320
00:09:59,839 --> 00:10:02,320
i'm going to press ctrl a with my mouse

321
00:10:02,320 --> 00:10:04,640
over this and this is going to apply the

322
00:10:04,640 --> 00:10:06,480
modifier so now if i tap into edit mode

323
00:10:06,480 --> 00:10:08,480
you can see that it's actual vertices

324
00:10:08,480 --> 00:10:10,320
now it adds a lot of extra vertices in

325
00:10:10,320 --> 00:10:11,839
here and that's a little bit annoying so

326
00:10:11,839 --> 00:10:13,200
i'm just going to get rid of these you

327
00:10:13,200 --> 00:10:14,240
don't really have to it's not really

328
00:10:14,240 --> 00:10:15,839
going to affect the look but it will

329
00:10:15,839 --> 00:10:17,839
make it a little bit lower poly so to

330
00:10:17,839 --> 00:10:19,600
get rid of these pretty quickly i'm

331
00:10:19,600 --> 00:10:21,839
going to go up here and click on this

332
00:10:21,839 --> 00:10:24,480
merge auto merge vertices what that'll

333
00:10:24,480 --> 00:10:26,800
do is when the vertices get really close

334
00:10:26,800 --> 00:10:27,920
to each other they're going to merge

335
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:30,720
together so now what i can do is alt

336
00:10:30,720 --> 00:10:32,480
select one of these loops and then

337
00:10:32,480 --> 00:10:34,320
double tap g move it down or actually

338
00:10:34,320 --> 00:10:36,399
i'll move it up and then when i let go

339
00:10:36,399 --> 00:10:38,320
it automatically merges it together so i

340
00:10:38,320 --> 00:10:39,760
can double tap g

341
00:10:39,760 --> 00:10:41,519
pull it up let go it's going to merge

342
00:10:41,519 --> 00:10:44,320
that i can alt select this double tap g

343
00:10:44,320 --> 00:10:46,240
edge slide and then place that double

344
00:10:46,240 --> 00:10:48,640
tap g again double tap g again and i can

345
00:10:48,640 --> 00:10:50,399
very quickly just get rid of all those

346
00:10:50,399 --> 00:10:53,440
extra vertices if you'd like to okay i'm

347
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,200
going to do that up here so click on

348
00:10:55,200 --> 00:10:57,680
this one you can alt select a loop and

349
00:10:57,680 --> 00:11:00,480
then double tap g click double tap g

350
00:11:00,480 --> 00:11:01,839
double tap g

351
00:11:01,839 --> 00:11:03,920
okay double tap g just keep on doing

352
00:11:03,920 --> 00:11:06,560
that bringing it around all right there

353
00:11:06,560 --> 00:11:08,480
we go so now the tree is a lot lower

354
00:11:08,480 --> 00:11:10,720
poly let's tap back into object mode now

355
00:11:10,720 --> 00:11:12,480
and now let's make the rest of the tree

356
00:11:12,480 --> 00:11:13,839
so i'm just going to click to place my

357
00:11:13,839 --> 00:11:15,839
3d cursor right about there i'll press

358
00:11:15,839 --> 00:11:18,560
shift and i'm going to add an icosphere

359
00:11:18,560 --> 00:11:20,079
now it's really big right now let's just

360
00:11:20,079 --> 00:11:22,399
zoom out on the icosphere settings right

361
00:11:22,399 --> 00:11:24,079
here i want to turn this up don't turn

362
00:11:24,079 --> 00:11:25,839
it up too high because if you turned up

363
00:11:25,839 --> 00:11:27,120
really high it could make it really

364
00:11:27,120 --> 00:11:29,440
laggy and possibly crash blender but i'm

365
00:11:29,440 --> 00:11:31,600
just going to turn this up to 5 and then

366
00:11:31,600 --> 00:11:34,160
i can just click on this and scale it

367
00:11:34,160 --> 00:11:36,000
down so we're just going to scale it

368
00:11:36,000 --> 00:11:37,120
down

369
00:11:37,120 --> 00:11:39,760
and then i can also tab and edit mode

370
00:11:39,760 --> 00:11:41,760
scale it on the z and then just scale

371
00:11:41,760 --> 00:11:43,519
that up a little bit more and i need to

372
00:11:43,519 --> 00:11:44,720
make it a little bit bigger so that the

373
00:11:44,720 --> 00:11:46,959
branches go into it all right so now i

374
00:11:46,959 --> 00:11:48,959
need to make the shape of the tree what

375
00:11:48,959 --> 00:11:51,360
i'm going to do is press the o key and

376
00:11:51,360 --> 00:11:52,320
that's going to turn on this

377
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:55,040
proportional editing right here now if i

378
00:11:55,040 --> 00:11:57,279
just click on a point and press g to

379
00:11:57,279 --> 00:11:59,279
grab you can see that it's pulling along

380
00:11:59,279 --> 00:12:01,680
vertices with it now if i scroll wheel i

381
00:12:01,680 --> 00:12:04,160
need to scroll my wheel down you can see

382
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,160
that there is this circle here and this

383
00:12:06,160 --> 00:12:08,320
circle is telling it how much is going

384
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,320
to be pulled along with it so i can just

385
00:12:10,320 --> 00:12:12,320
pull it around and i can make smooth

386
00:12:12,320 --> 00:12:13,839
adjustments so i can just click on some

387
00:12:13,839 --> 00:12:16,480
points press g and just move them around

388
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:18,079
and that way i can very quickly and

389
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:20,800
easily make the shape of my tree so just

390
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,800
make it kind of lumpy and random and

391
00:12:22,800 --> 00:12:24,639
maybe pull it out a little bit more

392
00:12:24,639 --> 00:12:26,720
where the branches are so there's some

393
00:12:26,720 --> 00:12:28,639
more leaves where the branches are and

394
00:12:28,639 --> 00:12:30,720
then maybe click on the top press g move

395
00:12:30,720 --> 00:12:32,320
it up a bit more

396
00:12:32,320 --> 00:12:33,680
alright so i like that so i'm going to

397
00:12:33,680 --> 00:12:35,600
tab back into object mode now to give it

398
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:37,440
that low poly look again i'm going to

399
00:12:37,440 --> 00:12:39,279
click on add modifier and just like the

400
00:12:39,279 --> 00:12:41,200
mountain i'm going to add the decimate

401
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:43,920
modifier so this ratio here i can turn

402
00:12:43,920 --> 00:12:45,440
this down and you can see that now it

403
00:12:45,440 --> 00:12:47,440
starts to have that low poly look so

404
00:12:47,440 --> 00:12:48,800
just turn it way down you can also hold

405
00:12:48,800 --> 00:12:50,800
the shift key as you're pulling this

406
00:12:50,800 --> 00:12:53,760
ratio down so that the movements are a

407
00:12:53,760 --> 00:12:56,160
lot more sensitive and then once you're

408
00:12:56,160 --> 00:12:58,079
happy with it you can hold your mouse

409
00:12:58,079 --> 00:13:00,399
over this and press ctrl a so now it

410
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:03,040
looks very low poly so now let's add the

411
00:13:03,040 --> 00:13:05,040
material onto the tree and then we'll

412
00:13:05,040 --> 00:13:07,120
add the apples or the fruit or whatever

413
00:13:07,120 --> 00:13:09,040
is on the tree so i'm going to press z

414
00:13:09,040 --> 00:13:10,720
move my mouse up to go into a rendered

415
00:13:10,720 --> 00:13:12,639
view and then i'm going to go to the

416
00:13:12,639 --> 00:13:14,399
material panel right here i'll click on

417
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,480
new and i'm going to call this green now

418
00:13:16,480 --> 00:13:17,760
i'm calling this green because i'm

419
00:13:17,760 --> 00:13:19,200
actually going to use this in a bunch of

420
00:13:19,200 --> 00:13:21,040
the assets almost all the assets are

421
00:13:21,040 --> 00:13:23,040
going to be using the same material so

422
00:13:23,040 --> 00:13:24,480
what i'm going to do is turn the base

423
00:13:24,480 --> 00:13:26,240
color to a green color

424
00:13:26,240 --> 00:13:28,160
make it a little bit darker a bit more

425
00:13:28,160 --> 00:13:30,240
saturated of a green color and then

426
00:13:30,240 --> 00:13:31,920
right down here the roughness turn that

427
00:13:31,920 --> 00:13:33,519
up just a little bit more and then i'm

428
00:13:33,519 --> 00:13:36,560
going to select the tree trunk click on

429
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:39,040
new and i can call this wood and then

430
00:13:39,040 --> 00:13:40,480
this one for the base color i'm just

431
00:13:40,480 --> 00:13:42,800
going to make this a brown color

432
00:13:42,800 --> 00:13:44,560
a bit darker than that

433
00:13:44,560 --> 00:13:47,040
maybe a little less saturated and then

434
00:13:47,040 --> 00:13:49,440
i'm going to turn the roughness up a bit

435
00:13:49,440 --> 00:13:51,199
just like that and then i think i'll

436
00:13:51,199 --> 00:13:52,560
select the leaves and just scale the

437
00:13:52,560 --> 00:13:54,480
whole thing up a little bit more alright

438
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:56,000
so now let's go ahead and make the

439
00:13:56,000 --> 00:13:58,320
apples so i'm going to place my 3d

440
00:13:58,320 --> 00:14:00,160
cursor right here and then i'll press

441
00:14:00,160 --> 00:14:02,160
shift a and i'm going to add another

442
00:14:02,160 --> 00:14:04,720
icosphere i'll zoom way out here now

443
00:14:04,720 --> 00:14:06,240
don't move the icosphere because if you

444
00:14:06,240 --> 00:14:07,920
do these settings will disappear on the

445
00:14:07,920 --> 00:14:09,279
subdivisions i'm going to turn this all

446
00:14:09,279 --> 00:14:11,600
the way down to one so the minimum

447
00:14:11,600 --> 00:14:13,519
close this and now i can just scale this

448
00:14:13,519 --> 00:14:15,519
down and this is going to be our apple

449
00:14:15,519 --> 00:14:17,120
so just put it in there i'm going to

450
00:14:17,120 --> 00:14:19,440
click on new and call this material

451
00:14:19,440 --> 00:14:21,760
apple and then i'm going to make this a

452
00:14:21,760 --> 00:14:23,600
red color i don't want to make it too

453
00:14:23,600 --> 00:14:25,440
saturated because if it's super red then

454
00:14:25,440 --> 00:14:27,040
it could look a little bit unrealistic

455
00:14:27,040 --> 00:14:28,800
if it's super super deep red i'm going

456
00:14:28,800 --> 00:14:30,320
to make it a little less saturated and

457
00:14:30,320 --> 00:14:31,920
slightly more orange i think that just

458
00:14:31,920 --> 00:14:33,839
looks a little bit nicer and i forgot to

459
00:14:33,839 --> 00:14:35,040
mention this but if you haven't saved

460
00:14:35,040 --> 00:14:36,399
your file yet it's probably a pretty

461
00:14:36,399 --> 00:14:38,160
good idea to save this just in case

462
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:39,600
blender crashes you won't lose anything

463
00:14:39,600 --> 00:14:41,680
so just go file and save and save your

464
00:14:41,680 --> 00:14:43,600
project so now i just need to select

465
00:14:43,600 --> 00:14:45,279
this apple and i'm just going to press

466
00:14:45,279 --> 00:14:47,760
shift d shift d will duplicate the

467
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:49,440
object and i'm just going to manually

468
00:14:49,440 --> 00:14:51,199
place them around i was thinking about

469
00:14:51,199 --> 00:14:52,880
using a particle system and if you had a

470
00:14:52,880 --> 00:14:54,560
lot of apples you could do that but

471
00:14:54,560 --> 00:14:55,920
because we don't have that many apples

472
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,199
i'm just going to manually place them

473
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,360
around and usually the fruit is going to

474
00:14:59,360 --> 00:15:01,199
be kind of hanging down so i think it

475
00:15:01,199 --> 00:15:03,680
looks better if the fruit or the apples

476
00:15:03,680 --> 00:15:05,600
is down here if you have the apples up

477
00:15:05,600 --> 00:15:07,279
here i think that kind of seems a little

478
00:15:07,279 --> 00:15:08,720
weird so i'm just going to have some

479
00:15:08,720 --> 00:15:10,959
apples kind of hanging down more at the

480
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:13,040
bottom of the tree so just go around

481
00:15:13,040 --> 00:15:14,800
here and make however many apples you

482
00:15:14,800 --> 00:15:16,320
want and if you wanted to you could

483
00:15:16,320 --> 00:15:18,000
model some low poly fruit like maybe

484
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,240
some pears or some other fruit like some

485
00:15:20,240 --> 00:15:21,760
plums or some other fruit like that that

486
00:15:21,760 --> 00:15:23,600
grows on trees you could also just

487
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:26,240
slightly vary the size of them because

488
00:15:26,240 --> 00:15:28,480
apples are just randomly different sizes

489
00:15:28,480 --> 00:15:29,759
some of them are a little bit bigger and

490
00:15:29,759 --> 00:15:31,199
some of them are a little bit smaller so

491
00:15:31,199 --> 00:15:33,199
you can just give the fruit some random

492
00:15:33,199 --> 00:15:34,959
scale here and then one more thing

493
00:15:34,959 --> 00:15:36,480
really quick i think this might be just

494
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,800
slightly too high poly i'm just going to

495
00:15:38,800 --> 00:15:40,639
add another decimate modifier just turn

496
00:15:40,639 --> 00:15:42,480
this down slightly

497
00:15:42,480 --> 00:15:43,680
or something like that and then press

498
00:15:43,680 --> 00:15:45,040
control a to apply that i think that

499
00:15:45,040 --> 00:15:46,800
looks just a little bit nicer so now i

500
00:15:46,800 --> 00:15:48,480
want to join all these objects together

501
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:49,920
so that when we grab the tree and move

502
00:15:49,920 --> 00:15:51,519
it they're all going to be moved along

503
00:15:51,519 --> 00:15:53,040
so i'm going to press z go into

504
00:15:53,040 --> 00:15:55,519
wireframe just press b and box select

505
00:15:55,519 --> 00:15:57,839
this area and then i'm going to press

506
00:15:57,839 --> 00:15:59,920
ctrl j and now they're all joined

507
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,759
together so if i press z and move my

508
00:16:01,759 --> 00:16:03,519
mouse up into render mode and just move

509
00:16:03,519 --> 00:16:05,759
around you can see that now they're all

510
00:16:05,759 --> 00:16:08,000
one object i'm just going to place this

511
00:16:08,000 --> 00:16:10,240
tree into the ground just slightly and

512
00:16:10,240 --> 00:16:12,480
then we'll go on to the next tree all

513
00:16:12,480 --> 00:16:13,920
right the next tree is pretty simple

514
00:16:13,920 --> 00:16:15,279
we're just going to be making a long

515
00:16:15,279 --> 00:16:16,959
tree kind of coming up so i'm going to

516
00:16:16,959 --> 00:16:18,959
center my 3d cursor right here i'm going

517
00:16:18,959 --> 00:16:21,199
to press shift a and i'm going to go to

518
00:16:21,199 --> 00:16:23,279
mesh and i'm going to add a cube and i

519
00:16:23,279 --> 00:16:24,880
guess i modeled everything pretty small

520
00:16:24,880 --> 00:16:26,240
because whenever i add in the objects

521
00:16:26,240 --> 00:16:27,839
they're really big so i'm just going to

522
00:16:27,839 --> 00:16:29,920
scale this way down and this is going to

523
00:16:29,920 --> 00:16:32,320
be the trunk for our tree so i want it

524
00:16:32,320 --> 00:16:34,160
to be the same materials so i'm going to

525
00:16:34,160 --> 00:16:35,680
click on the tree right here and then

526
00:16:35,680 --> 00:16:37,600
i'm going to click on wood and then i

527
00:16:37,600 --> 00:16:40,959
can drag this color and drop color it on

528
00:16:40,959 --> 00:16:42,800
there now it's going to add the material

529
00:16:42,800 --> 00:16:45,360
to that object so i can tab in edit mode

530
00:16:45,360 --> 00:16:47,360
now i'm going to press 3 to go to face

531
00:16:47,360 --> 00:16:49,440
select and select this face

532
00:16:49,440 --> 00:16:52,160
press 1 to go to the front view and then

533
00:16:52,160 --> 00:16:54,480
i'll press g and z bring this up and you

534
00:16:54,480 --> 00:16:55,920
can see that the proportional editing is

535
00:16:55,920 --> 00:16:57,360
still on so i can just click this to

536
00:16:57,360 --> 00:17:00,079
turn it off or press the o key so then

537
00:17:00,079 --> 00:17:02,000
just select this top face again i'll

538
00:17:02,000 --> 00:17:05,280
press 1 for front view g and z bring it

539
00:17:05,280 --> 00:17:08,079
up and then s and scale it down now this

540
00:17:08,079 --> 00:17:09,679
tree trick is pretty square right now

541
00:17:09,679 --> 00:17:10,959
and i want to give it a little bit more

542
00:17:10,959 --> 00:17:12,959
faces on some of the sides so so i'm

543
00:17:12,959 --> 00:17:14,880
going to press 2 and that'll go to the

544
00:17:14,880 --> 00:17:16,400
edge select and then i'll just select

545
00:17:16,400 --> 00:17:18,720
this edge and then i'll press ctrl b and

546
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,319
that's going to add a bevel just make it

547
00:17:20,319 --> 00:17:22,559
a random size like that and then click

548
00:17:22,559 --> 00:17:25,439
on this one ctrl b add another bevel

549
00:17:25,439 --> 00:17:27,119
and i want the size to be different so

550
00:17:27,119 --> 00:17:28,880
maybe i'll make this one really small

551
00:17:28,880 --> 00:17:31,200
and then select this edge ctrl b maybe

552
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:32,960
make this one a pretty big one and then

553
00:17:32,960 --> 00:17:35,520
select this one ctrl b so now the tree

554
00:17:35,520 --> 00:17:37,120
trunk just has a bit more of a random

555
00:17:37,120 --> 00:17:39,200
shape so now i'm going to press shift a

556
00:17:39,200 --> 00:17:41,600
and i'm going to add another icosphere

557
00:17:41,600 --> 00:17:42,960
and i need to zoom out and go to the

558
00:17:42,960 --> 00:17:45,200
icosphere settings right here this one

559
00:17:45,200 --> 00:17:47,120
i'm gonna set back up to like five or

560
00:17:47,120 --> 00:17:50,000
six and then i'll scale this way down

561
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:52,720
and then press g and z bring it up i'll

562
00:17:52,720 --> 00:17:54,320
press one for front view so i can see

563
00:17:54,320 --> 00:17:55,840
kind of how high this is

564
00:17:55,840 --> 00:17:58,080
scale it up a little bit more okay now

565
00:17:58,080 --> 00:18:00,559
i'm gonna tab into edit mode and just go

566
00:18:00,559 --> 00:18:03,039
up to the top here i'll press o and

567
00:18:03,039 --> 00:18:04,559
that'll turn on the proportional editing

568
00:18:04,559 --> 00:18:06,480
again and just click on an area on the

569
00:18:06,480 --> 00:18:09,280
top here and then i'll press g and z

570
00:18:09,280 --> 00:18:11,120
bring it up and you can scroll your

571
00:18:11,120 --> 00:18:13,280
scroll wheel to change how big that

572
00:18:13,280 --> 00:18:14,880
circle is just make it something like

573
00:18:14,880 --> 00:18:16,640
that and then also just select a few

574
00:18:16,640 --> 00:18:18,880
more points i think i'll go back into

575
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:20,640
the vertex select just select some

576
00:18:20,640 --> 00:18:22,960
points kind of pull them around to give

577
00:18:22,960 --> 00:18:24,799
it a little bit more of a random shape

578
00:18:24,799 --> 00:18:26,640
maybe just make it a little bit flatter

579
00:18:26,640 --> 00:18:28,720
on the bottom here and just pull in some

580
00:18:28,720 --> 00:18:30,559
of the areas just make it a little bit

581
00:18:30,559 --> 00:18:32,480
more random all right so now that we

582
00:18:32,480 --> 00:18:33,919
have the basic shape of this i'm going

583
00:18:33,919 --> 00:18:36,559
to go to add modifier and once again add

584
00:18:36,559 --> 00:18:39,360
this really great decimate modifier turn

585
00:18:39,360 --> 00:18:41,200
this down and it's going to give that

586
00:18:41,200 --> 00:18:43,280
really awesome low poly look now you can

587
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:44,799
see that the faces are pretty stretched

588
00:18:44,799 --> 00:18:45,919
right here and they're not very

589
00:18:45,919 --> 00:18:47,919
stretched down here so if you don't like

590
00:18:47,919 --> 00:18:49,840
this i'll show you what i'm gonna do to

591
00:18:49,840 --> 00:18:51,600
get rid of that so there we go i like

592
00:18:51,600 --> 00:18:52,960
how that is i think i'll just actually

593
00:18:52,960 --> 00:18:55,600
pull this out just make it a tad bit

594
00:18:55,600 --> 00:18:57,760
smaller okay there we go so now with my

595
00:18:57,760 --> 00:18:59,760
mouse over this i'm going to press ctrl

596
00:18:59,760 --> 00:19:02,720
a and that will apply that modifier now

597
00:19:02,720 --> 00:19:04,160
down here on the bottom of the tree if i

598
00:19:04,160 --> 00:19:05,600
want to make this the same amount of

599
00:19:05,600 --> 00:19:07,919
detail as the top here i can tab into

600
00:19:07,919 --> 00:19:10,160
edit mode select one of these vertices

601
00:19:10,160 --> 00:19:12,000
just pick one and this is still turned

602
00:19:12,000 --> 00:19:13,600
on we turned this on earlier the auto

603
00:19:13,600 --> 00:19:16,400
merge vertices so if i double tap g

604
00:19:16,400 --> 00:19:18,400
and just push this in it's going to

605
00:19:18,400 --> 00:19:19,760
merge with it and now there's going to

606
00:19:19,760 --> 00:19:22,000
be less vertices now we still have this

607
00:19:22,000 --> 00:19:23,679
thing on here so i'm going to press o to

608
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:25,679
turn it off and now i can just select

609
00:19:25,679 --> 00:19:28,720
some points and double tap g and that's

610
00:19:28,720 --> 00:19:30,559
going to do the edge slide and i can

611
00:19:30,559 --> 00:19:32,559
just drag them around and get rid of

612
00:19:32,559 --> 00:19:33,840
some of the vertices so i'm just going

613
00:19:33,840 --> 00:19:35,440
to go around here and do that a little

614
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:37,520
bit on some of these areas so that the

615
00:19:37,520 --> 00:19:40,720
vertices count is more even across the

616
00:19:40,720 --> 00:19:43,039
entire object so now i'm going to press

617
00:19:43,039 --> 00:19:44,799
z move my mouse up we'll go into

618
00:19:44,799 --> 00:19:47,360
rendered mode i'm going to select this

619
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,919
and click over here to

620
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:52,000
the materials click on the green color

621
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:53,679
and then i can just drag and drop this

622
00:19:53,679 --> 00:19:55,760
on and now it has the green color i

623
00:19:55,760 --> 00:19:57,120
think i'll just scale this up and bring

624
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,120
it down just slightly now you can see

625
00:19:59,120 --> 00:20:00,880
that these green colors are exactly the

626
00:20:00,880 --> 00:20:02,799
same and this is okay if you're fine

627
00:20:02,799 --> 00:20:04,159
with it but what i want to do is just

628
00:20:04,159 --> 00:20:06,720
add a little bit of varying color in all

629
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:09,039
of the different green objects so what

630
00:20:09,039 --> 00:20:10,640
i'm going to do is click on the shading

631
00:20:10,640 --> 00:20:12,720
tab and then i'm going to press period

632
00:20:12,720 --> 00:20:15,280
on the number pad to jump over here and

633
00:20:15,280 --> 00:20:17,200
you can see that here is the shader

634
00:20:17,200 --> 00:20:19,520
nodes so what i'm going to do is right

635
00:20:19,520 --> 00:20:21,679
here press shift a and i'm going to

636
00:20:21,679 --> 00:20:24,559
search for the object info node just

637
00:20:24,559 --> 00:20:26,559
drop it right in here and what i'm going

638
00:20:26,559 --> 00:20:28,640
to use is this random value and i'm

639
00:20:28,640 --> 00:20:30,960
going to plug this random value into the

640
00:20:30,960 --> 00:20:32,799
base color and then when i give it

641
00:20:32,799 --> 00:20:34,480
different random colors it's going to

642
00:20:34,480 --> 00:20:36,240
just slightly make the different objects

643
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:38,559
slightly different varying colors of

644
00:20:38,559 --> 00:20:40,400
green so now what i can do is press

645
00:20:40,400 --> 00:20:42,559
shift a here search for a color ramp and

646
00:20:42,559 --> 00:20:44,960
drop the color amp right in here so now

647
00:20:44,960 --> 00:20:46,400
what it's going to do is the different

648
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:47,760
objects if i just like duplicate this

649
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:48,960
you can see that the colors are going to

650
00:20:48,960 --> 00:20:51,360
be randomly different through the black

651
00:20:51,360 --> 00:20:53,039
to the white so now i can just change

652
00:20:53,039 --> 00:20:54,880
these colors so this black one here i'm

653
00:20:54,880 --> 00:20:56,880
going to make a dark green and then this

654
00:20:56,880 --> 00:20:59,360
white one here i'm going to make a light

655
00:20:59,360 --> 00:21:01,200
green so i don't want it to be too light

656
00:21:01,200 --> 00:21:03,600
because i don't want it to look crazy

657
00:21:03,600 --> 00:21:05,120
bright and then this one maybe just a

658
00:21:05,120 --> 00:21:06,400
little bit darker and then in between

659
00:21:06,400 --> 00:21:08,000
this i can make a couple more colors so

660
00:21:08,000 --> 00:21:09,919
i'm going to click on the plus here to

661
00:21:09,919 --> 00:21:11,280
make a new color

662
00:21:11,280 --> 00:21:13,360
drag the tab over and this one i think i

663
00:21:13,360 --> 00:21:14,960
want to be a little less saturated a

664
00:21:14,960 --> 00:21:16,799
little more gray something like that

665
00:21:16,799 --> 00:21:18,080
maybe just make it a little bit darker

666
00:21:18,080 --> 00:21:19,919
and then i can click on the plus again

667
00:21:19,919 --> 00:21:21,200
to add another one this one i'm going to

668
00:21:21,200 --> 00:21:22,880
drag over here and then this one i can

669
00:21:22,880 --> 00:21:24,559
make just a little bit more saturated

670
00:21:24,559 --> 00:21:26,159
and a little bit brighter i'm going to

671
00:21:26,159 --> 00:21:28,000
make that one fully saturated just up

672
00:21:28,000 --> 00:21:29,039
like that

673
00:21:29,039 --> 00:21:30,480
maybe make that just a little bit

674
00:21:30,480 --> 00:21:32,480
brighter so now you can see if i just

675
00:21:32,480 --> 00:21:34,320
select these and duplicate them just to

676
00:21:34,320 --> 00:21:35,919
show you whenever i duplicate them

677
00:21:35,919 --> 00:21:37,280
they're just going to randomly be

678
00:21:37,280 --> 00:21:39,039
different colors and that just adds a

679
00:21:39,039 --> 00:21:40,559
lot and just makes it a little bit

680
00:21:40,559 --> 00:21:42,320
cooler so i'm just going to delete these

681
00:21:42,320 --> 00:21:44,799
now oop delete these ones let's go back

682
00:21:44,799 --> 00:21:47,440
into the layout here so there is the

683
00:21:47,440 --> 00:21:50,000
second tree so i'm going to select this

684
00:21:50,000 --> 00:21:51,840
and shift select this and then press

685
00:21:51,840 --> 00:21:54,559
ctrl j all right let's go ahead and make

686
00:21:54,559 --> 00:21:57,360
the third tree now so i'm going to click

687
00:21:57,360 --> 00:21:59,600
and place my 3d cursor right there and

688
00:21:59,600 --> 00:22:01,280
then i'll press shift a and once again

689
00:22:01,280 --> 00:22:03,919
i'm going to add a plane i'm going to

690
00:22:03,919 --> 00:22:07,520
tab into edit mode and press s to scale

691
00:22:07,520 --> 00:22:10,320
0 and then enter and then because we

692
00:22:10,320 --> 00:22:12,240
have that auto merge turned on there

693
00:22:12,240 --> 00:22:14,000
already is one vertice because they

694
00:22:14,000 --> 00:22:16,080
already got joined together so now i can

695
00:22:16,080 --> 00:22:18,240
press 1 to go to front view and i can

696
00:22:18,240 --> 00:22:19,919
just extrude this up so press e to

697
00:22:19,919 --> 00:22:22,080
extrude bring that up and i'm going to

698
00:22:22,080 --> 00:22:24,000
make this tree have a bunch of different

699
00:22:24,000 --> 00:22:25,600
branches so i'm going to extrude it kind

700
00:22:25,600 --> 00:22:27,120
of make it kind of wobbly and then

701
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,760
extrude this up and over and this one's

702
00:22:29,760 --> 00:22:30,880
just going to have a bunch of different

703
00:22:30,880 --> 00:22:32,320
branches

704
00:22:32,320 --> 00:22:34,480
and then we'll have some different uh

705
00:22:34,480 --> 00:22:36,720
green blobs for

706
00:22:36,720 --> 00:22:38,880
the leaves on the tree and i want these

707
00:22:38,880 --> 00:22:40,400
to be somewhat 3d as well so i'm going

708
00:22:40,400 --> 00:22:43,440
to box select a branch rotate it over

709
00:22:43,440 --> 00:22:45,200
just so that's a little more three

710
00:22:45,200 --> 00:22:47,440
dimensional i think i'll press ctrl r

711
00:22:47,440 --> 00:22:49,760
right in here click to add a vertice and

712
00:22:49,760 --> 00:22:51,280
then i can extrude this out and make

713
00:22:51,280 --> 00:22:53,600
another branch bring that branch up i'm

714
00:22:53,600 --> 00:22:55,679
going to press ctrl r here click to add

715
00:22:55,679 --> 00:22:57,120
a vertice

716
00:22:57,120 --> 00:22:59,280
and then extrude that out all right and

717
00:22:59,280 --> 00:23:01,120
then once you like how that looks i'm

718
00:23:01,120 --> 00:23:02,480
going to go to over here to the

719
00:23:02,480 --> 00:23:04,960
modifiers click on add modifier and we

720
00:23:04,960 --> 00:23:07,280
are going to add the skin modifier just

721
00:23:07,280 --> 00:23:09,600
like before now for some reason it's

722
00:23:09,600 --> 00:23:11,520
really big i'm going to tab into edit

723
00:23:11,520 --> 00:23:14,240
mode uh press a to select everything and

724
00:23:14,240 --> 00:23:17,919
press ctrl a and make it really small

725
00:23:17,919 --> 00:23:19,760
pressing ctrl a with that whole thing

726
00:23:19,760 --> 00:23:21,360
selected i don't know why it was really

727
00:23:21,360 --> 00:23:23,760
big all right there we go so now i'm

728
00:23:23,760 --> 00:23:26,400
just going to press z go into wireframe

729
00:23:26,400 --> 00:23:28,640
a to deselect everything and just b and

730
00:23:28,640 --> 00:23:31,840
box select the middle part of the trunk

731
00:23:31,840 --> 00:23:33,520
scale that up because i want the trunk

732
00:23:33,520 --> 00:23:36,000
to be a bit thicker so i'm pressing ctrl

733
00:23:36,000 --> 00:23:38,559
a and that'll scale up the skin modifier

734
00:23:38,559 --> 00:23:40,080
and then i want the bottom to be even

735
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:42,480
thicker so i will just box select just

736
00:23:42,480 --> 00:23:44,960
the bottom ctrl a make that even thicker

737
00:23:44,960 --> 00:23:46,400
and then just select this bottom one

738
00:23:46,400 --> 00:23:48,720
here ctrl a and make it really thick and

739
00:23:48,720 --> 00:23:50,960
maybe move it down a little bit all

740
00:23:50,960 --> 00:23:52,480
right now you can see that there's some

741
00:23:52,480 --> 00:23:54,240
weird glitches here and this is because

742
00:23:54,240 --> 00:23:56,880
of the angle of the vertices so if i

743
00:23:56,880 --> 00:23:58,960
just tap into edit mode press z go into

744
00:23:58,960 --> 00:24:01,039
wireframe just select this if i just

745
00:24:01,039 --> 00:24:02,640
play around with this you can see that

746
00:24:02,640 --> 00:24:05,600
now let me just play around with this if

747
00:24:05,600 --> 00:24:08,000
you make the angle wider then it'll fix

748
00:24:08,000 --> 00:24:09,440
itself so there we go that looks a lot

749
00:24:09,440 --> 00:24:11,200
better and then the branches here i want

750
00:24:11,200 --> 00:24:13,039
them to slowly get thinner and thinner

751
00:24:13,039 --> 00:24:15,919
so i can just hold down the shift key

752
00:24:15,919 --> 00:24:18,400
and select these vertices here

753
00:24:18,400 --> 00:24:20,159
and then press ctrl a and make them even

754
00:24:20,159 --> 00:24:21,200
thinner

755
00:24:21,200 --> 00:24:22,960
and then i'm just going to

756
00:24:22,960 --> 00:24:25,200
box select some of these parts right

757
00:24:25,200 --> 00:24:27,679
here kind of more at the starting of the

758
00:24:27,679 --> 00:24:29,919
branches ctrl a just make them a little

759
00:24:29,919 --> 00:24:31,840
bit thicker so once you're happy with

760
00:24:31,840 --> 00:24:34,159
your tree again ctrl a with your mouse

761
00:24:34,159 --> 00:24:36,799
over the skin modifier to apply that and

762
00:24:36,799 --> 00:24:39,200
then if you want to again you can hold

763
00:24:39,200 --> 00:24:41,679
down the alt key and select a loop and

764
00:24:41,679 --> 00:24:43,440
just keep on double tapping g and moving

765
00:24:43,440 --> 00:24:44,960
it over and that way you can get rid of

766
00:24:44,960 --> 00:24:46,960
some of those extra loops because the

767
00:24:46,960 --> 00:24:49,200
skin modifier adds in some extra loops

768
00:24:49,200 --> 00:24:52,000
right in there so just alt select a loop

769
00:24:52,000 --> 00:24:54,080
double tap g and bring it up and with

770
00:24:54,080 --> 00:24:55,760
that auto merge turn on it's going to

771
00:24:55,760 --> 00:24:58,240
automatically merge them together so i'm

772
00:24:58,240 --> 00:25:00,080
just going to keep doing that for a few

773
00:25:00,080 --> 00:25:02,960
areas here all right there we go now

774
00:25:02,960 --> 00:25:04,640
this may have happened for you or it may

775
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,240
not but basically there's some glitches

776
00:25:06,240 --> 00:25:08,080
here and this is because i applied the

777
00:25:08,080 --> 00:25:09,919
skin modifier while it still was acting

778
00:25:09,919 --> 00:25:11,360
a little bit weird so i just need to

779
00:25:11,360 --> 00:25:13,200
manually fix this so i'm going to press

780
00:25:13,200 --> 00:25:15,679
3 to go to face select just select some

781
00:25:15,679 --> 00:25:17,760
of the extra faces in there press x and

782
00:25:17,760 --> 00:25:20,000
delete faces and then i need to press 1

783
00:25:20,000 --> 00:25:22,400
for vertex select just hold down the

784
00:25:22,400 --> 00:25:24,559
shift key and select the points and then

785
00:25:24,559 --> 00:25:26,000
fill them with f

786
00:25:26,000 --> 00:25:27,440
hopefully this didn't happen for you but

787
00:25:27,440 --> 00:25:29,679
if it did it's a pretty easy fix and

788
00:25:29,679 --> 00:25:31,120
there's another face in there so i'll

789
00:25:31,120 --> 00:25:32,720
delete that face

790
00:25:32,720 --> 00:25:34,720
and then just select the vertices and

791
00:25:34,720 --> 00:25:37,039
fill that with f so once again just like

792
00:25:37,039 --> 00:25:38,640
the other trees i'm going to press shift

793
00:25:38,640 --> 00:25:41,520
a search for an icosphere

794
00:25:41,520 --> 00:25:43,520
and then just scale this down and we're

795
00:25:43,520 --> 00:25:45,440
going to make the little blobs of the

796
00:25:45,440 --> 00:25:47,440
tree where the leaves are so i'm going

797
00:25:47,440 --> 00:25:50,400
to tab into edit mode press o or turn on

798
00:25:50,400 --> 00:25:52,400
this proportional editing and just give

799
00:25:52,400 --> 00:25:54,480
it a random shape something that looks

800
00:25:54,480 --> 00:25:56,240
good for you now since this is the main

801
00:25:56,240 --> 00:25:58,480
trunk coming up i'm gonna have this blob

802
00:25:58,480 --> 00:26:00,240
be the biggest so just make this blog

803
00:26:00,240 --> 00:26:02,159
really big and then the other blobs that

804
00:26:02,159 --> 00:26:04,240
are coming off of the uh branches

805
00:26:04,240 --> 00:26:06,159
they're gonna be a lot smaller all right

806
00:26:06,159 --> 00:26:08,320
there we go so i will click on add

807
00:26:08,320 --> 00:26:11,760
modifier add the decimate modifier make

808
00:26:11,760 --> 00:26:14,799
it way down about there okay and then i

809
00:26:14,799 --> 00:26:16,640
will press shift d to duplicate this

810
00:26:16,640 --> 00:26:18,240
scale it down and just stick it right in

811
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:20,320
there so the branches are going into it

812
00:26:20,320 --> 00:26:23,120
i can tab into edit mode now and adjust

813
00:26:23,120 --> 00:26:25,360
this so i can make it different than the

814
00:26:25,360 --> 00:26:27,279
other one and i definitely want it to be

815
00:26:27,279 --> 00:26:28,400
smaller

816
00:26:28,400 --> 00:26:31,440
so i will scale it down okay like that

817
00:26:31,440 --> 00:26:33,360
and then i actually want this branch to

818
00:26:33,360 --> 00:26:34,480
be a little bit farther away because

819
00:26:34,480 --> 00:26:36,880
it's a bit too close to this main piece

820
00:26:36,880 --> 00:26:39,440
right here so i'm going to select the

821
00:26:39,440 --> 00:26:41,919
branch tab and edit mode

822
00:26:41,919 --> 00:26:43,679
z and move my mouse over to go into

823
00:26:43,679 --> 00:26:45,840
wireframe i'll press a to deselect

824
00:26:45,840 --> 00:26:47,360
everything and then i'm just going to

825
00:26:47,360 --> 00:26:48,400
press b

826
00:26:48,400 --> 00:26:50,880
box select this area right here

827
00:26:50,880 --> 00:26:52,799
i'll press r and rotate that just bring

828
00:26:52,799 --> 00:26:54,240
it over so that there's a little bit

829
00:26:54,240 --> 00:26:56,400
more space there all right now i can

830
00:26:56,400 --> 00:26:58,799
select this one press shift d and move

831
00:26:58,799 --> 00:27:00,720
it over once you kind of get it into

832
00:27:00,720 --> 00:27:03,360
place i can tab and edit mode and then

833
00:27:03,360 --> 00:27:05,520
just select some points and continue to

834
00:27:05,520 --> 00:27:07,279
change it make it a little bit more

835
00:27:07,279 --> 00:27:09,279
unique okay so let's just do that for

836
00:27:09,279 --> 00:27:12,240
the last one shift d move this over

837
00:27:12,240 --> 00:27:14,320
make this one maybe even smaller change

838
00:27:14,320 --> 00:27:16,480
it up a bit okay and now let's add

839
00:27:16,480 --> 00:27:18,640
materials to this tree so press z move

840
00:27:18,640 --> 00:27:21,200
your mouse up you can select this tree

841
00:27:21,200 --> 00:27:23,039
and click over here to the materials and

842
00:27:23,039 --> 00:27:25,279
then the wood here drop it onto the wood

843
00:27:25,279 --> 00:27:27,360
and then select the green and just drop

844
00:27:27,360 --> 00:27:30,480
it onto all of the leaves there just

845
00:27:30,480 --> 00:27:31,919
like that all right so now i'm just

846
00:27:31,919 --> 00:27:34,000
going to select the leaves go to the

847
00:27:34,000 --> 00:27:36,000
modifiers and then with your mouse over

848
00:27:36,000 --> 00:27:38,000
the modifier press ctrl a

849
00:27:38,000 --> 00:27:40,559
just apply all of these and then once

850
00:27:40,559 --> 00:27:42,480
they're all applied you can shift select

851
00:27:42,480 --> 00:27:45,679
all of them and then press ctrl j all

852
00:27:45,679 --> 00:27:46,960
right let's make that tree that kind of

853
00:27:46,960 --> 00:27:48,480
is like a pine tree or kind of like a

854
00:27:48,480 --> 00:27:50,399
christmas tree so i'm going to actually

855
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:52,640
use this one so i'm going to select this

856
00:27:52,640 --> 00:27:55,039
press shift d click with my middle mouse

857
00:27:55,039 --> 00:27:57,200
move it over here and then i'll just tab

858
00:27:57,200 --> 00:27:59,120
into edit mode and then i can hover my

859
00:27:59,120 --> 00:28:01,039
mouse over this and press l and that's

860
00:28:01,039 --> 00:28:03,039
going to select all the linked vertices

861
00:28:03,039 --> 00:28:04,799
and then i can press x and delete

862
00:28:04,799 --> 00:28:06,960
vertices so now we're just going to be

863
00:28:06,960 --> 00:28:09,440
working with the trunk so now i'm going

864
00:28:09,440 --> 00:28:12,320
to press shift a and i'm going to add a

865
00:28:12,320 --> 00:28:13,919
cylinder i'm going to scale this

866
00:28:13,919 --> 00:28:16,320
cylinder down and just put it kind of

867
00:28:16,320 --> 00:28:17,440
right there

868
00:28:17,440 --> 00:28:20,080
on the tree trunk press three for face

869
00:28:20,080 --> 00:28:21,760
select and just select this top face

870
00:28:21,760 --> 00:28:24,799
right here and then using s just scale

871
00:28:24,799 --> 00:28:26,799
that down and just make it really small

872
00:28:26,799 --> 00:28:28,240
and then i'm going to add some loop cuts

873
00:28:28,240 --> 00:28:29,760
in here because i want to add a lot more

874
00:28:29,760 --> 00:28:32,159
geometry to work with so i'll press ctrl

875
00:28:32,159 --> 00:28:34,159
r and i can actually scroll up and

876
00:28:34,159 --> 00:28:35,679
scroll way up and just add a bunch of

877
00:28:35,679 --> 00:28:37,919
vertices and then you can double click

878
00:28:37,919 --> 00:28:40,320
to place that so now i'm going to press

879
00:28:40,320 --> 00:28:41,919
l with my mouse hovered over this to

880
00:28:41,919 --> 00:28:43,600
select all the linked vertices i'll

881
00:28:43,600 --> 00:28:45,760
press p and separate this by selection

882
00:28:45,760 --> 00:28:47,360
because i actually want it to be its own

883
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:49,440
object so i can tab into object mode

884
00:28:49,440 --> 00:28:51,919
select this and then i'm going to click

885
00:28:51,919 --> 00:28:54,480
down here and then just remove the wood

886
00:28:54,480 --> 00:28:56,000
here so i'm just going to remove that

887
00:28:56,000 --> 00:28:57,919
and now it's just the green material so

888
00:28:57,919 --> 00:28:59,919
now what i can do is tab into edit mode

889
00:28:59,919 --> 00:29:01,919
press 1 to go to the vertex select and

890
00:29:01,919 --> 00:29:04,080
just select some vertices and once again

891
00:29:04,080 --> 00:29:06,480
press o to turn on proportional editing

892
00:29:06,480 --> 00:29:08,000
and just move this around and make it

893
00:29:08,000 --> 00:29:09,440
kind of random just give it a little bit

894
00:29:09,440 --> 00:29:12,399
of randomness some lumpy parts just that

895
00:29:12,399 --> 00:29:14,399
it's not perfect this will make it look

896
00:29:14,399 --> 00:29:16,559
more organic then once you're happy with

897
00:29:16,559 --> 00:29:18,559
that you can go over to the modifiers

898
00:29:18,559 --> 00:29:21,440
and once again add the decimate modifier

899
00:29:21,440 --> 00:29:22,960
turn this way down

900
00:29:22,960 --> 00:29:25,039
and you can see what it's doing so just

901
00:29:25,039 --> 00:29:26,320
turn it down to something that you like

902
00:29:26,320 --> 00:29:28,320
i like that and then with my mouse over

903
00:29:28,320 --> 00:29:30,880
this i can press ctrl a to apply that

904
00:29:30,880 --> 00:29:32,880
i'll press g and z and bring this up and

905
00:29:32,880 --> 00:29:34,320
then one last thing before we start

906
00:29:34,320 --> 00:29:36,240
duplicating these i'm going to go up

907
00:29:36,240 --> 00:29:40,000
here tab into edit mode i'm going to

908
00:29:40,000 --> 00:29:41,679
press 3 to go to the face select and

909
00:29:41,679 --> 00:29:43,840
just select this face and then i need to

910
00:29:43,840 --> 00:29:45,760
turn off the proportional editing again

911
00:29:45,760 --> 00:29:48,880
and then i'll press s and 0 and enter

912
00:29:48,880 --> 00:29:50,240
and that way it's just going to merge

913
00:29:50,240 --> 00:29:52,000
these together because the merge is on

914
00:29:52,000 --> 00:29:54,320
and now it's really pointy at the top so

915
00:29:54,320 --> 00:29:56,399
now i can press one to go to side view

916
00:29:56,399 --> 00:29:58,480
just bring this over and scale it down

917
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:00,799
and then i can press shift d click with

918
00:30:00,799 --> 00:30:02,080
my middle mouse

919
00:30:02,080 --> 00:30:05,120
scale it up and then also press r and z

920
00:30:05,120 --> 00:30:06,799
and rotate it around so that it has a

921
00:30:06,799 --> 00:30:08,480
random rotation

922
00:30:08,480 --> 00:30:10,000
also you could rotate that so that this

923
00:30:10,000 --> 00:30:11,200
bottom part here is a little bit

924
00:30:11,200 --> 00:30:13,039
straighter okay let's do that again i

925
00:30:13,039 --> 00:30:14,480
want to add four of them so i'll press

926
00:30:14,480 --> 00:30:16,880
shift d again r and z give it a random

927
00:30:16,880 --> 00:30:18,880
rotation and then just scale it up even

928
00:30:18,880 --> 00:30:19,760
more

929
00:30:19,760 --> 00:30:21,279
make sure that it's straight you can see

930
00:30:21,279 --> 00:30:23,120
that this is way off because i rotated

931
00:30:23,120 --> 00:30:26,399
it so i need to straighten that all out

932
00:30:26,399 --> 00:30:27,360
okay

933
00:30:27,360 --> 00:30:29,600
select this last one shift d

934
00:30:29,600 --> 00:30:30,399
z

935
00:30:30,399 --> 00:30:33,440
and then r and z and rotate it give it a

936
00:30:33,440 --> 00:30:35,039
random rotation let me just scale this

937
00:30:35,039 --> 00:30:36,399
up a bit as well because i want them to

938
00:30:36,399 --> 00:30:38,159
slowly scale up bigger and bigger and

939
00:30:38,159 --> 00:30:39,440
then as they get higher up they're going

940
00:30:39,440 --> 00:30:41,440
to be smaller and smaller and then also

941
00:30:41,440 --> 00:30:43,039
you can tab in edit mode and just select

942
00:30:43,039 --> 00:30:45,039
some points press o to turn on

943
00:30:45,039 --> 00:30:47,120
proportional editing and you can just

944
00:30:47,120 --> 00:30:49,200
play around with this and just change

945
00:30:49,200 --> 00:30:50,960
the shape of it a little bit and then

946
00:30:50,960 --> 00:30:52,399
once you're happy with your pine tree

947
00:30:52,399 --> 00:30:54,720
i'm going to shift select the entire

948
00:30:54,720 --> 00:30:58,080
tree and press ctrl j so there we go

949
00:30:58,080 --> 00:31:00,799
there's our four different trees alright

950
00:31:00,799 --> 00:31:03,039
so next let's do the wooden log so i'm

951
00:31:03,039 --> 00:31:05,519
going to place my 3d cursor right here

952
00:31:05,519 --> 00:31:07,600
i'll press shift a and i'm going to

953
00:31:07,600 --> 00:31:10,080
search for a circle now the circle here

954
00:31:10,080 --> 00:31:12,320
if i open up the circle settings it's 32

955
00:31:12,320 --> 00:31:14,000
which is pretty high i'm gonna change

956
00:31:14,000 --> 00:31:15,840
this down to like an eight and that way

957
00:31:15,840 --> 00:31:18,240
it'll be a lot less geometry i'll scale

958
00:31:18,240 --> 00:31:19,919
this down and then i can press r to

959
00:31:19,919 --> 00:31:22,559
rotate and y on the y-axis and then just

960
00:31:22,559 --> 00:31:25,919
type in 9-0 and enter and that way it's

961
00:31:25,919 --> 00:31:28,159
rotated sideways so i can just scale

962
00:31:28,159 --> 00:31:31,200
this down kind of bring it down onto the

963
00:31:31,200 --> 00:31:33,120
grass now what i'm going to do is press

964
00:31:33,120 --> 00:31:35,600
7 for top view bring this over so i can

965
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:37,200
see it a little bit better i'll tab into

966
00:31:37,200 --> 00:31:39,440
edit mode and just start to extrude this

967
00:31:39,440 --> 00:31:41,840
out so extrude it out and then i will

968
00:31:41,840 --> 00:31:43,200
turn off proportional editing because i

969
00:31:43,200 --> 00:31:44,559
don't want to use that

970
00:31:44,559 --> 00:31:46,720
and then i'll press e and extrude kind

971
00:31:46,720 --> 00:31:48,720
of bring it down a little bit something

972
00:31:48,720 --> 00:31:50,240
like this and scale it down a little bit

973
00:31:50,240 --> 00:31:52,960
more and then e to extrude bring it out

974
00:31:52,960 --> 00:31:54,640
even more and scale it a little bit more

975
00:31:54,640 --> 00:31:56,559
so it slowly gets smaller and smaller as

976
00:31:56,559 --> 00:31:58,240
it goes over and then i think i'll just

977
00:31:58,240 --> 00:32:00,240
hold down alt select this loop and scale

978
00:32:00,240 --> 00:32:01,919
that up a little bit alright so there's

979
00:32:01,919 --> 00:32:03,120
our log we need to give it some

980
00:32:03,120 --> 00:32:04,640
thickness though so i'm going to go to

981
00:32:04,640 --> 00:32:07,519
add modifier and add the solidify

982
00:32:07,519 --> 00:32:09,679
modifier and then on the thickness here

983
00:32:09,679 --> 00:32:11,279
just turn this up i'm going to hold down

984
00:32:11,279 --> 00:32:13,919
the shift key as i turn up this value

985
00:32:13,919 --> 00:32:15,519
and then i'm going to press ctrl a with

986
00:32:15,519 --> 00:32:17,760
my mouse over this modifier to apply it

987
00:32:17,760 --> 00:32:20,000
so now it's actual geometry now i want

988
00:32:20,000 --> 00:32:22,240
to put a hole in our log so what i'm

989
00:32:22,240 --> 00:32:24,559
going to do is press ctrl r add a loop

990
00:32:24,559 --> 00:32:25,919
cut right there

991
00:32:25,919 --> 00:32:28,559
click to place it ctrl r add another one

992
00:32:28,559 --> 00:32:30,399
place it about there and then ctrl r add

993
00:32:30,399 --> 00:32:32,320
another one click to place it right in

994
00:32:32,320 --> 00:32:33,760
the center so basically what i'm going

995
00:32:33,760 --> 00:32:35,760
to do is i'm going to cut out a hole

996
00:32:35,760 --> 00:32:37,600
right in the log now because this log

997
00:32:37,600 --> 00:32:39,440
has thickness i do need to add loop cuts

998
00:32:39,440 --> 00:32:41,440
inside it as well so i'm going to press

999
00:32:41,440 --> 00:32:42,880
z move my mouse over to go into

1000
00:32:42,880 --> 00:32:44,640
wireframe and then it's a little bit

1001
00:32:44,640 --> 00:32:45,919
hard to see but if you kind of go at an

1002
00:32:45,919 --> 00:32:47,519
angle it's a little bit easier press

1003
00:32:47,519 --> 00:32:49,360
ctrl r i'm going to add one loop guy

1004
00:32:49,360 --> 00:32:52,320
here ctrl r another loop kind of in the

1005
00:32:52,320 --> 00:32:55,120
center and then ctrl r and one more out

1006
00:32:55,120 --> 00:32:57,840
here so if i just go up here i can

1007
00:32:57,840 --> 00:33:00,000
double tap g and just kind of place

1008
00:33:00,000 --> 00:33:01,679
these and just align them up with the

1009
00:33:01,679 --> 00:33:03,840
other ones so alt select that one you

1010
00:33:03,840 --> 00:33:05,600
can see it's in the middle there if i

1011
00:33:05,600 --> 00:33:07,279
press 7 for top view you can probably

1012
00:33:07,279 --> 00:33:08,880
see it a little bit better and then i

1013
00:33:08,880 --> 00:33:11,360
can double tap g and just get it about

1014
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:13,679
the same as the other one so alt select

1015
00:33:13,679 --> 00:33:16,480
this double tap g all right now before

1016
00:33:16,480 --> 00:33:18,320
we cut this out i do want to make this a

1017
00:33:18,320 --> 00:33:20,559
circular shape and to do that i'm going

1018
00:33:20,559 --> 00:33:22,559
to actually use a blender add-on it's

1019
00:33:22,559 --> 00:33:24,559
built into blender though so to turn it

1020
00:33:24,559 --> 00:33:26,000
on you can go edit

1021
00:33:26,000 --> 00:33:28,000
go to preferences and then right over

1022
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:30,640
here you can start typing in loop tools

1023
00:33:30,640 --> 00:33:32,159
just turn on the loop tools just check

1024
00:33:32,159 --> 00:33:34,399
mark that and then close this now when

1025
00:33:34,399 --> 00:33:36,880
you check mark it when you press n to

1026
00:33:36,880 --> 00:33:39,039
open up this panel you can go over to

1027
00:33:39,039 --> 00:33:41,279
edit and you can see here is the loop

1028
00:33:41,279 --> 00:33:43,519
tools add-on so when i click on it you

1029
00:33:43,519 --> 00:33:44,960
can see it has all these different

1030
00:33:44,960 --> 00:33:47,120
things what i can do is i can select the

1031
00:33:47,120 --> 00:33:49,360
vertices and then i can click on circle

1032
00:33:49,360 --> 00:33:51,039
and it's going to turn them into a

1033
00:33:51,039 --> 00:33:53,440
circle so i'm going to press 3 to go to

1034
00:33:53,440 --> 00:33:55,039
the face select click on this and then

1035
00:33:55,039 --> 00:33:56,799
shift click on this and then if i click

1036
00:33:56,799 --> 00:33:58,960
on the circle you can see now it is a

1037
00:33:58,960 --> 00:34:01,360
circle so i want to rotate it over so

1038
00:34:01,360 --> 00:34:03,360
it's a bit straighter with the log so i

1039
00:34:03,360 --> 00:34:06,320
will press r just rotate that over maybe

1040
00:34:06,320 --> 00:34:08,320
scale it down a little bit more alright

1041
00:34:08,320 --> 00:34:09,839
now i need to do the same thing for the

1042
00:34:09,839 --> 00:34:12,239
one inside so i will click on this shift

1043
00:34:12,239 --> 00:34:13,440
click on this

1044
00:34:13,440 --> 00:34:14,960
click on circle

1045
00:34:14,960 --> 00:34:15,918
and then

1046
00:34:15,918 --> 00:34:17,359
go back up here if i just go into

1047
00:34:17,359 --> 00:34:19,359
wireframe by pressing z and moving my

1048
00:34:19,359 --> 00:34:22,079
mouse over i can just align this up

1049
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:23,918
and scale it down

1050
00:34:23,918 --> 00:34:25,599
okay now i want to delete these so i'll

1051
00:34:25,599 --> 00:34:27,760
press x and delete faces

1052
00:34:27,760 --> 00:34:30,079
and then go out of wireframe select this

1053
00:34:30,079 --> 00:34:32,560
one x and delete faces select this one

1054
00:34:32,560 --> 00:34:35,280
and x and delete faces so now we have a

1055
00:34:35,280 --> 00:34:37,280
hole coming out of our log but you can

1056
00:34:37,280 --> 00:34:39,280
see that you can see inside the

1057
00:34:39,280 --> 00:34:41,440
thickness of the log so i need to add

1058
00:34:41,440 --> 00:34:44,159
faces right along here so to do this i'm

1059
00:34:44,159 --> 00:34:46,000
going to press 1 to go to the vertex

1060
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:46,879
select

1061
00:34:46,879 --> 00:34:48,879
just alt and click on this loop and then

1062
00:34:48,879 --> 00:34:51,280
hold down the shift key and alt key and

1063
00:34:51,280 --> 00:34:53,679
select this loop so now i have both of

1064
00:34:53,679 --> 00:34:56,000
those selected now you could manually

1065
00:34:56,000 --> 00:34:58,560
fill those with the f key and make faces

1066
00:34:58,560 --> 00:35:01,200
but what i'm going to do is press f3 to

1067
00:35:01,200 --> 00:35:03,839
go to the search and start typing in

1068
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:06,079
bridge edge loops and if you click on

1069
00:35:06,079 --> 00:35:06,880
this

1070
00:35:06,880 --> 00:35:08,960
it automatically merges those together

1071
00:35:08,960 --> 00:35:10,400
as long as both sides have the same

1072
00:35:10,400 --> 00:35:12,079
amount of vertices it just fills all the

1073
00:35:12,079 --> 00:35:13,280
faces

1074
00:35:13,280 --> 00:35:15,200
and it works great just like that and

1075
00:35:15,200 --> 00:35:16,640
then i think i might hold down the shift

1076
00:35:16,640 --> 00:35:18,480
key select these two

1077
00:35:18,480 --> 00:35:20,720
press g and move them down a bit so that

1078
00:35:20,720 --> 00:35:22,640
they're a little bit more round with the

1079
00:35:22,640 --> 00:35:23,599
log

1080
00:35:23,599 --> 00:35:25,920
select these two press g and move those

1081
00:35:25,920 --> 00:35:27,599
down a little bit and then i think i'll

1082
00:35:27,599 --> 00:35:30,000
select this entire loop again just by

1083
00:35:30,000 --> 00:35:31,440
holding down the shift key and selecting

1084
00:35:31,440 --> 00:35:33,599
these loops and then just press control

1085
00:35:33,599 --> 00:35:34,320
b

1086
00:35:34,320 --> 00:35:35,920
and add a bevel there and that way it

1087
00:35:35,920 --> 00:35:38,320
just looks a little bit nicer okay let's

1088
00:35:38,320 --> 00:35:40,560
move over here and i want to give this a

1089
00:35:40,560 --> 00:35:42,400
little bit more detail so what i'll do

1090
00:35:42,400 --> 00:35:44,480
is tab into edit mode here alt select

1091
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,160
this loop and then i'll just scale it

1092
00:35:46,160 --> 00:35:47,359
down just to make it a little bit

1093
00:35:47,359 --> 00:35:49,359
thicker and then i'll press three to go

1094
00:35:49,359 --> 00:35:51,359
to the face select and just select a few

1095
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:52,960
different faces here

1096
00:35:52,960 --> 00:35:54,720
and then i'll press e and extrude them

1097
00:35:54,720 --> 00:35:56,560
out kind of like this is the bark of the

1098
00:35:56,560 --> 00:35:58,079
tree and the bark of the tree is just

1099
00:35:58,079 --> 00:35:59,440
going up a little bit like there's kind

1100
00:35:59,440 --> 00:36:01,440
of a lip you could also press one to go

1101
00:36:01,440 --> 00:36:03,520
to vertex select just select a few

1102
00:36:03,520 --> 00:36:06,000
vertices and just move them around to

1103
00:36:06,000 --> 00:36:07,920
just give a little bit more random shape

1104
00:36:07,920 --> 00:36:10,160
and then let's move around over to the

1105
00:36:10,160 --> 00:36:12,000
other side here and i want to make this

1106
00:36:12,000 --> 00:36:14,000
a little bit thicker as well so i'll tab

1107
00:36:14,000 --> 00:36:16,400
into edit mode hold down the alt key and

1108
00:36:16,400 --> 00:36:18,079
select this loop and scale it in a

1109
00:36:18,079 --> 00:36:19,920
little bit and then you can see that the

1110
00:36:19,920 --> 00:36:21,520
ground is coming through here so i just

1111
00:36:21,520 --> 00:36:23,280
need to press g and z

1112
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,440
and bring this object up you can also

1113
00:36:25,440 --> 00:36:27,599
double tap r and rotate that a little

1114
00:36:27,599 --> 00:36:29,200
bit to make it a little bit flatter and

1115
00:36:29,200 --> 00:36:31,760
then g and z just bring that up because

1116
00:36:31,760 --> 00:36:33,040
i don't want the ground to be coming

1117
00:36:33,040 --> 00:36:34,640
through there all right so i'm going to

1118
00:36:34,640 --> 00:36:36,800
tab into edit mode press 3 to go to face

1119
00:36:36,800 --> 00:36:38,400
select and i'm just going to select a

1120
00:36:38,400 --> 00:36:40,160
few different parts right here and do

1121
00:36:40,160 --> 00:36:42,560
the same thing so e to extrude and then

1122
00:36:42,560 --> 00:36:44,640
i think i'll s and just scale that out

1123
00:36:44,640 --> 00:36:46,480
just a little bit and then i want to add

1124
00:36:46,480 --> 00:36:48,320
a little crack here in the log so i'm

1125
00:36:48,320 --> 00:36:50,000
going to press ctrl r

1126
00:36:50,000 --> 00:36:51,760
click and bring this down and then i

1127
00:36:51,760 --> 00:36:53,760
want to add another one so ctrl r just

1128
00:36:53,760 --> 00:36:55,680
add another loop cut in there so we have

1129
00:36:55,680 --> 00:36:57,520
two loop cuts really close to each other

1130
00:36:57,520 --> 00:36:58,880
and then i need to set a point for the

1131
00:36:58,880 --> 00:37:01,520
crack to end so i'll press ctrl r

1132
00:37:01,520 --> 00:37:03,599
click and bring this over just like that

1133
00:37:03,599 --> 00:37:05,040
and then i'll press one for vertex

1134
00:37:05,040 --> 00:37:06,960
select and just select this loop double

1135
00:37:06,960 --> 00:37:09,359
tap g and bring it over and if i click

1136
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:10,880
there it's automatically going to merge

1137
00:37:10,880 --> 00:37:12,880
using the merge and then click on this

1138
00:37:12,880 --> 00:37:15,119
double tap g and again using that auto

1139
00:37:15,119 --> 00:37:17,280
merge it'll automatically merge together

1140
00:37:17,280 --> 00:37:19,440
so now we have a little crack in our log

1141
00:37:19,440 --> 00:37:20,560
and if we want to make it a little bit

1142
00:37:20,560 --> 00:37:22,800
bigger i can just shift and select these

1143
00:37:22,800 --> 00:37:24,320
two vertices

1144
00:37:24,320 --> 00:37:26,079
bring it up a little bit to make that

1145
00:37:26,079 --> 00:37:27,760
cut look a little bit bigger so now

1146
00:37:27,760 --> 00:37:29,440
let's add a couple of branches in our

1147
00:37:29,440 --> 00:37:31,920
log so i'm going to tab in edit mode

1148
00:37:31,920 --> 00:37:34,480
just alt select this loop press shift d

1149
00:37:34,480 --> 00:37:37,440
to duplicate it we can scale it down

1150
00:37:37,440 --> 00:37:40,640
rotate it with r and then press g

1151
00:37:40,640 --> 00:37:42,720
bring it over and just stick it inside

1152
00:37:42,720 --> 00:37:44,640
our log and i just want to stick it in

1153
00:37:44,640 --> 00:37:46,160
between that thickness there so it

1154
00:37:46,160 --> 00:37:48,079
doesn't come out on the other side so

1155
00:37:48,079 --> 00:37:50,160
once that's in place there i can press e

1156
00:37:50,160 --> 00:37:52,800
to extrude extrude it out and then r to

1157
00:37:52,800 --> 00:37:54,800
rotate s to scale and we're just going

1158
00:37:54,800 --> 00:37:57,200
to keep on extruding that out and make a

1159
00:37:57,200 --> 00:38:00,640
little limb or a branch coming out of

1160
00:38:00,640 --> 00:38:02,720
the tree trunk and then once that's as

1161
00:38:02,720 --> 00:38:04,640
far as you want you can press f to fill

1162
00:38:04,640 --> 00:38:06,720
that face now i want to have just a tiny

1163
00:38:06,720 --> 00:38:08,560
little branch coming out of this branch

1164
00:38:08,560 --> 00:38:10,800
so to do that i'll press ctrl r add a

1165
00:38:10,800 --> 00:38:12,480
loop cut right there and then i'm going

1166
00:38:12,480 --> 00:38:15,040
to press ctrl r add a loop cut in there

1167
00:38:15,040 --> 00:38:17,040
and then press 3 to go to face select

1168
00:38:17,040 --> 00:38:18,240
and i'm just going to select these two

1169
00:38:18,240 --> 00:38:20,960
vertices i can press n to open up that

1170
00:38:20,960 --> 00:38:23,440
panel again and there is our loop tools

1171
00:38:23,440 --> 00:38:25,200
click on circle and it will make it a

1172
00:38:25,200 --> 00:38:27,599
circle and then you can scale this up a

1173
00:38:27,599 --> 00:38:30,079
little bit and extrude it out scale it

1174
00:38:30,079 --> 00:38:32,000
down and that way you can just add a

1175
00:38:32,000 --> 00:38:33,680
little tiny branch coming off of the

1176
00:38:33,680 --> 00:38:35,680
bigger branch okay that looks pretty

1177
00:38:35,680 --> 00:38:37,119
good so i want to add something like

1178
00:38:37,119 --> 00:38:38,880
that to the other side so i'm just going

1179
00:38:38,880 --> 00:38:40,320
to duplicate it and then modify it a

1180
00:38:40,320 --> 00:38:42,560
little bit so i'm going to click

1181
00:38:42,560 --> 00:38:44,480
somewhere on here and then press l with

1182
00:38:44,480 --> 00:38:46,720
my mouse over this to select the entire

1183
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:48,640
branch i'm just going to press 7 for top

1184
00:38:48,640 --> 00:38:50,800
view and then i'll press shift d to

1185
00:38:50,800 --> 00:38:52,400
duplicate this over

1186
00:38:52,400 --> 00:38:55,200
press r to rotate and scale it down a

1187
00:38:55,200 --> 00:38:56,720
little bit because this is higher up on

1188
00:38:56,720 --> 00:38:58,800
the tree so the branches would probably

1189
00:38:58,800 --> 00:39:00,640
be a little bit smaller and just put it

1190
00:39:00,640 --> 00:39:02,240
into place but make sure you can't see

1191
00:39:02,240 --> 00:39:04,160
it inside the tree trunk and then to

1192
00:39:04,160 --> 00:39:05,440
rotate this around it just make it a

1193
00:39:05,440 --> 00:39:07,040
little bit different i'll just rotate

1194
00:39:07,040 --> 00:39:09,599
this maybe bring it kind of down here

1195
00:39:09,599 --> 00:39:11,520
and then i can press one to go to vertex

1196
00:39:11,520 --> 00:39:14,480
select a to deselect everything z and

1197
00:39:14,480 --> 00:39:15,760
move my mouse over we can go into

1198
00:39:15,760 --> 00:39:17,040
wireframe

1199
00:39:17,040 --> 00:39:19,520
b and box select this area just kind of

1200
00:39:19,520 --> 00:39:21,359
rotate it and change

1201
00:39:21,359 --> 00:39:23,440
the shape of it a little bit and then

1202
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:24,880
one last thing before we finish the

1203
00:39:24,880 --> 00:39:26,560
modeling for this log i do feel like

1204
00:39:26,560 --> 00:39:28,400
it's a little bit too long so if you

1205
00:39:28,400 --> 00:39:30,720
want to you can just box select an area

1206
00:39:30,720 --> 00:39:33,440
in edit mode bring the whole thing back

1207
00:39:33,440 --> 00:39:35,280
box select this area and bring it back

1208
00:39:35,280 --> 00:39:36,800
just to make the log a little bit less

1209
00:39:36,800 --> 00:39:38,800
long alright so now let's do the

1210
00:39:38,800 --> 00:39:41,040
materials for our log so i'm going to

1211
00:39:41,040 --> 00:39:42,480
click right over here and i'm going to

1212
00:39:42,480 --> 00:39:44,160
click on this and i'm going to add the

1213
00:39:44,160 --> 00:39:46,480
wood material i'll press z and move my

1214
00:39:46,480 --> 00:39:48,560
mouse up to go into rendered mode and

1215
00:39:48,560 --> 00:39:50,000
what i want to do is i want to make the

1216
00:39:50,000 --> 00:39:51,599
wood that's inside a little bit lighter

1217
00:39:51,599 --> 00:39:53,440
because this is kind of the bark of the

1218
00:39:53,440 --> 00:39:55,280
wood so it's going to be darker and then

1219
00:39:55,280 --> 00:39:57,599
inside i want it to be lighter so to do

1220
00:39:57,599 --> 00:39:59,280
this i'm going to tab into edit mode

1221
00:39:59,280 --> 00:40:01,359
press 3 to go to the face select and

1222
00:40:01,359 --> 00:40:03,520
just alt select some of these so shift

1223
00:40:03,520 --> 00:40:06,079
and alt and select these different loops

1224
00:40:06,079 --> 00:40:08,000
going all the way around here and then

1225
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,760
i'm going to hold down the shift key and

1226
00:40:09,760 --> 00:40:12,240
just click on some of these bits right

1227
00:40:12,240 --> 00:40:14,079
here because these won't select properly

1228
00:40:14,079 --> 00:40:15,920
with the alt key because they have some

1229
00:40:15,920 --> 00:40:17,359
things getting in the way so i'm just

1230
00:40:17,359 --> 00:40:18,720
going to need to manually shift and

1231
00:40:18,720 --> 00:40:20,480
click on these and i'm basically just

1232
00:40:20,480 --> 00:40:22,480
selecting all the wood that's darker and

1233
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,640
then i will invert the selection and add

1234
00:40:24,640 --> 00:40:26,480
the lighter wood and then the branches

1235
00:40:26,480 --> 00:40:28,640
here i'll press l and l with my mouse

1236
00:40:28,640 --> 00:40:31,040
hovered over them to select them so now

1237
00:40:31,040 --> 00:40:33,520
i just have all the outside of the log

1238
00:40:33,520 --> 00:40:36,160
so now i can press ctrl i that'll invert

1239
00:40:36,160 --> 00:40:37,520
the selection and that's all the stuff

1240
00:40:37,520 --> 00:40:39,440
that i want to be the lighter color and

1241
00:40:39,440 --> 00:40:42,240
i'll click on the plus here click on new

1242
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:43,760
call it wood

1243
00:40:43,760 --> 00:40:46,480
light and then just make it a light wood

1244
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:48,880
color something kind of like that and

1245
00:40:48,880 --> 00:40:50,960
then click on a sign now this looks

1246
00:40:50,960 --> 00:40:52,640
pretty good but i do actually want this

1247
00:40:52,640 --> 00:40:54,240
log to be a bit darker so i'm going to

1248
00:40:54,240 --> 00:40:56,560
select this wood right here click on the

1249
00:40:56,560 --> 00:40:57,920
plus to duplicate it and i'm going to

1250
00:40:57,920 --> 00:40:58,880
call it

1251
00:40:58,880 --> 00:41:00,880
log just so that's a separate material

1252
00:41:00,880 --> 00:41:02,800
and i can make it a little bit darker so

1253
00:41:02,800 --> 00:41:04,160
on the base color i'll just bring this

1254
00:41:04,160 --> 00:41:05,040
down

1255
00:41:05,040 --> 00:41:06,800
make that a little bit darker that looks

1256
00:41:06,800 --> 00:41:08,880
a bit nicer all right so let's go ahead

1257
00:41:08,880 --> 00:41:11,920
and model the low poly tree stump now so

1258
00:41:11,920 --> 00:41:13,520
i'll press shift a we're going to start

1259
00:41:13,520 --> 00:41:15,760
with a circle and then make sure on the

1260
00:41:15,760 --> 00:41:17,440
circle settings make sure the vertices

1261
00:41:17,440 --> 00:41:19,520
is set to 8. i'm going to scale this

1262
00:41:19,520 --> 00:41:20,400
down

1263
00:41:20,400 --> 00:41:22,000
bring it over into the center here so

1264
00:41:22,000 --> 00:41:23,920
that we can see it a little bit better

1265
00:41:23,920 --> 00:41:25,280
tap into edit mode and just make sure

1266
00:41:25,280 --> 00:41:27,040
you're in the vertex select by pressing

1267
00:41:27,040 --> 00:41:30,319
one and then i'll press f to fill that

1268
00:41:30,319 --> 00:41:32,240
now i'm going to press e and z and

1269
00:41:32,240 --> 00:41:34,240
extrude this up and then i'll press e

1270
00:41:34,240 --> 00:41:37,119
and s scale that out make the thickness

1271
00:41:37,119 --> 00:41:39,280
of it and then i'll press e and z

1272
00:41:39,280 --> 00:41:41,440
bring it down okay now i need to bring

1273
00:41:41,440 --> 00:41:43,520
this object up because

1274
00:41:43,520 --> 00:41:45,359
it's a little bit too far down okay

1275
00:41:45,359 --> 00:41:47,119
there we go tab in edit mode i'm going

1276
00:41:47,119 --> 00:41:48,880
to scale this up a little bit because as

1277
00:41:48,880 --> 00:41:50,800
it comes down it's going to get bigger

1278
00:41:50,800 --> 00:41:53,040
so e and z

1279
00:41:53,040 --> 00:41:55,200
and then s scale that up and then i'm

1280
00:41:55,200 --> 00:41:56,800
going to press three to go to the face

1281
00:41:56,800 --> 00:41:58,960
select and just select a few points here

1282
00:41:58,960 --> 00:42:00,800
just select maybe about five of those

1283
00:42:00,800 --> 00:42:03,839
faces and then i'll press e and z

1284
00:42:03,839 --> 00:42:06,319
bring them up a little bit and i'll just

1285
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:08,240
slightly scale them up and then i want

1286
00:42:08,240 --> 00:42:09,680
to add one of those cracks in there

1287
00:42:09,680 --> 00:42:10,960
again because i think that looked pretty

1288
00:42:10,960 --> 00:42:12,640
cool on the log so i'm going to press

1289
00:42:12,640 --> 00:42:15,040
ctrl r bring a loop cut in there press

1290
00:42:15,040 --> 00:42:17,440
ctrl r add another loop cut right there

1291
00:42:17,440 --> 00:42:19,040
then i can press one to go to vertex

1292
00:42:19,040 --> 00:42:21,920
select just select this and double tap g

1293
00:42:21,920 --> 00:42:24,079
push it in click on this one double tap

1294
00:42:24,079 --> 00:42:25,839
g push it in and again because we have

1295
00:42:25,839 --> 00:42:28,000
that auto merge it's going to merge the

1296
00:42:28,000 --> 00:42:29,599
vertices together i think i'll just

1297
00:42:29,599 --> 00:42:31,200
select these bring them down a little

1298
00:42:31,200 --> 00:42:33,920
bit and then select these vertices bring

1299
00:42:33,920 --> 00:42:35,920
them out and these out a little bit i

1300
00:42:35,920 --> 00:42:37,200
think i'll bring this one down a little

1301
00:42:37,200 --> 00:42:38,400
bit as well

1302
00:42:38,400 --> 00:42:41,040
and just pop this one up a little bit so

1303
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,359
i'm going to scale this down a bit and

1304
00:42:43,359 --> 00:42:46,240
bring it down right onto the plane just

1305
00:42:46,240 --> 00:42:47,680
like that and then i'll go to the

1306
00:42:47,680 --> 00:42:49,920
material tab and then click on the drop

1307
00:42:49,920 --> 00:42:51,520
down menu and start typing in log and

1308
00:42:51,520 --> 00:42:53,920
just add in that log material and then

1309
00:42:53,920 --> 00:42:55,920
we need to add the roots for the log so

1310
00:42:55,920 --> 00:42:57,839
tab and edit mode just find a spot where

1311
00:42:57,839 --> 00:42:59,440
i want the roots to come out i want the

1312
00:42:59,440 --> 00:43:01,040
root to come out right here so i'll

1313
00:43:01,040 --> 00:43:02,720
press three to go to the face select

1314
00:43:02,720 --> 00:43:04,640
just select this face and press e to

1315
00:43:04,640 --> 00:43:05,760
extrude

1316
00:43:05,760 --> 00:43:07,440
and then scale it down a little bit and

1317
00:43:07,440 --> 00:43:10,319
rotate it and then e to extrude again

1318
00:43:10,319 --> 00:43:12,640
bring it down and just extrude that down

1319
00:43:12,640 --> 00:43:14,640
just like that so let's add another root

1320
00:43:14,640 --> 00:43:16,240
right here and i want this root to be a

1321
00:43:16,240 --> 00:43:17,839
little bit more round so to make it more

1322
00:43:17,839 --> 00:43:19,839
round i'm going to press ctrl r just

1323
00:43:19,839 --> 00:43:22,000
double click to add that loop cut and

1324
00:43:22,000 --> 00:43:24,319
then i can just select this double tap g

1325
00:43:24,319 --> 00:43:26,160
move it down a little bit select this

1326
00:43:26,160 --> 00:43:27,760
one double tap g move it down a little

1327
00:43:27,760 --> 00:43:29,839
bit and then i can just press three to

1328
00:43:29,839 --> 00:43:32,480
go to the face select just select these

1329
00:43:32,480 --> 00:43:34,960
faces and extrude that out and that way

1330
00:43:34,960 --> 00:43:36,640
you can see that the root is going to be

1331
00:43:36,640 --> 00:43:38,480
a little bit more round so i'll just

1332
00:43:38,480 --> 00:43:40,800
rotate it making sure it's still in the

1333
00:43:40,800 --> 00:43:41,839
ground

1334
00:43:41,839 --> 00:43:44,319
extrude it down and then extrude it in

1335
00:43:44,319 --> 00:43:46,319
just like that okay let's add one more

1336
00:43:46,319 --> 00:43:47,760
right here now this one i want to be a

1337
00:43:47,760 --> 00:43:49,920
smaller one so i'll press ctrl r just

1338
00:43:49,920 --> 00:43:52,640
drop that in there i'll select these two

1339
00:43:52,640 --> 00:43:54,560
bring them down to make that a little

1340
00:43:54,560 --> 00:43:56,800
bit smaller and then i can press three

1341
00:43:56,800 --> 00:43:59,040
to go to the face select select this and

1342
00:43:59,040 --> 00:44:01,520
then extrude that out with e and this

1343
00:44:01,520 --> 00:44:02,880
one i want to actually come up a little

1344
00:44:02,880 --> 00:44:04,720
bit so there's a little bit of an area

1345
00:44:04,720 --> 00:44:07,119
underneath the root so i'll extrude that

1346
00:44:07,119 --> 00:44:09,760
rotate it and then extrude it down

1347
00:44:09,760 --> 00:44:11,839
and into the ground and scale it down a

1348
00:44:11,839 --> 00:44:13,520
bit and then if you wanted to make this

1349
00:44:13,520 --> 00:44:14,960
root a little bit more round you could

1350
00:44:14,960 --> 00:44:17,040
tab into edit mode just alt select one

1351
00:44:17,040 --> 00:44:19,280
of these loop cuts and press ctrl b

1352
00:44:19,280 --> 00:44:21,040
just add a bevel there and that way

1353
00:44:21,040 --> 00:44:22,000
there's going to be a little bit more

1354
00:44:22,000 --> 00:44:24,240
geometry and it'll be a bit more smooth

1355
00:44:24,240 --> 00:44:25,440
all right so i'm going to call the

1356
00:44:25,440 --> 00:44:27,359
modeling good for that now just like the

1357
00:44:27,359 --> 00:44:29,680
log i want to make the wood later in

1358
00:44:29,680 --> 00:44:32,319
inside so i will tab into edit mode

1359
00:44:32,319 --> 00:44:33,920
press 3 to go to the face select and

1360
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,760
then select this face and then i'm going

1361
00:44:35,760 --> 00:44:38,160
to click plus to add a new material

1362
00:44:38,160 --> 00:44:40,240
click on this and start typing in wood

1363
00:44:40,240 --> 00:44:42,720
and we want to select the wood light and

1364
00:44:42,720 --> 00:44:44,640
then with that selected and the wood

1365
00:44:44,640 --> 00:44:46,960
light selected you can press assign and

1366
00:44:46,960 --> 00:44:48,960
now it's going to have the lighter wood

1367
00:44:48,960 --> 00:44:50,400
now i want to show those wood grains

1368
00:44:50,400 --> 00:44:52,800
kind of these circles inside the tree so

1369
00:44:52,800 --> 00:44:54,880
i'm going to tab into edit mode and i'm

1370
00:44:54,880 --> 00:44:56,880
just going to start by pressing i and

1371
00:44:56,880 --> 00:44:58,960
i'll press i and that'll inset the face

1372
00:44:58,960 --> 00:45:00,480
you can see that these vertices here are

1373
00:45:00,480 --> 00:45:01,920
really close to each other because we

1374
00:45:01,920 --> 00:45:04,000
added that cut in there so i'll press 1

1375
00:45:04,000 --> 00:45:06,480
to go to the vertex select just select a

1376
00:45:06,480 --> 00:45:08,560
vertices and then double tap g and just

1377
00:45:08,560 --> 00:45:10,319
move them away from each other double

1378
00:45:10,319 --> 00:45:12,319
tap g just give those a little bit more

1379
00:45:12,319 --> 00:45:14,079
space and just make sure all the rest

1380
00:45:14,079 --> 00:45:15,920
have a bit more space so now that they

1381
00:45:15,920 --> 00:45:17,839
have more space i'll press 3 to go to

1382
00:45:17,839 --> 00:45:19,920
face select just select this face i can

1383
00:45:19,920 --> 00:45:22,079
scale it up a little bit more and then i

1384
00:45:22,079 --> 00:45:25,040
can press i and just keep on pressing i

1385
00:45:25,040 --> 00:45:26,319
so just keep on doing this and what

1386
00:45:26,319 --> 00:45:27,359
we're going to do is we're going to make

1387
00:45:27,359 --> 00:45:29,760
every other loop a little bit brighter

1388
00:45:29,760 --> 00:45:30,960
now you can see that i have the same

1389
00:45:30,960 --> 00:45:33,119
problem here so i'm just going to press

1390
00:45:33,119 --> 00:45:35,920
1 to go to vertex select double tap g

1391
00:45:35,920 --> 00:45:37,599
double tap g just give that a little bit

1392
00:45:37,599 --> 00:45:39,839
more space i can press three again to go

1393
00:45:39,839 --> 00:45:42,160
the face select and just keep on

1394
00:45:42,160 --> 00:45:44,480
pressing i to inset that and i'm going

1395
00:45:44,480 --> 00:45:46,640
to call that good so now what i can do

1396
00:45:46,640 --> 00:45:48,640
is press three for face select just hold

1397
00:45:48,640 --> 00:45:50,640
down the alt key and select one of these

1398
00:45:50,640 --> 00:45:52,240
loops and then just hold down the shift

1399
00:45:52,240 --> 00:45:55,040
and alt key and select every other loop

1400
00:45:55,040 --> 00:45:56,640
and then just hold down the shift key

1401
00:45:56,640 --> 00:45:58,480
and you can select the middle one now

1402
00:45:58,480 --> 00:45:59,680
what i want to do is i want to make all

1403
00:45:59,680 --> 00:46:01,520
those a little bit brighter so i'll

1404
00:46:01,520 --> 00:46:03,200
click on this plus here

1405
00:46:03,200 --> 00:46:05,040
click on this type in wood and i'm going

1406
00:46:05,040 --> 00:46:07,040
to select the wood light and then i'm

1407
00:46:07,040 --> 00:46:09,280
going to click on this kind of file icon

1408
00:46:09,280 --> 00:46:11,040
it looks like two pieces of paper click

1409
00:46:11,040 --> 00:46:12,560
on that it's going to duplicate it i'm

1410
00:46:12,560 --> 00:46:15,520
going to call this wood light 2

1411
00:46:15,520 --> 00:46:17,200
and then with that selected i can click

1412
00:46:17,200 --> 00:46:19,680
on a sign and nothing will change that's

1413
00:46:19,680 --> 00:46:21,520
because it's the same color right now

1414
00:46:21,520 --> 00:46:23,520
but this color if i make it brighter you

1415
00:46:23,520 --> 00:46:25,920
can now see that it stands out and then

1416
00:46:25,920 --> 00:46:27,440
if you wanted to you could also press

1417
00:46:27,440 --> 00:46:29,680
three to go to face select and just

1418
00:46:29,680 --> 00:46:31,440
select some of these faces in here and

1419
00:46:31,440 --> 00:46:33,920
also make them the lighter material

1420
00:46:33,920 --> 00:46:35,359
so i'm just gonna select all the

1421
00:46:35,359 --> 00:46:37,359
interfaces

1422
00:46:37,359 --> 00:46:39,440
just like that click on the wood light

1423
00:46:39,440 --> 00:46:41,839
and then click on assign and there we go

1424
00:46:41,839 --> 00:46:44,640
there is our finished tree stump so i'll

1425
00:46:44,640 --> 00:46:47,119
press 7 for top view move this over

1426
00:46:47,119 --> 00:46:48,560
scale it down a little bit and just

1427
00:46:48,560 --> 00:46:49,599
place it

1428
00:46:49,599 --> 00:46:51,520
right over here just make sure it's

1429
00:46:51,520 --> 00:46:54,160
going down into the ground

1430
00:46:54,160 --> 00:46:55,680
all right let's go ahead and make the

1431
00:46:55,680 --> 00:46:57,760
flowers now so to make the flowers i'm

1432
00:46:57,760 --> 00:46:59,760
actually going to start off with adding

1433
00:46:59,760 --> 00:47:03,040
a cube so press shift a add a cube

1434
00:47:03,040 --> 00:47:04,720
we'll scale this cube down i'm just

1435
00:47:04,720 --> 00:47:06,720
going to bring it over here so we can

1436
00:47:06,720 --> 00:47:08,640
work with it a little bit better period

1437
00:47:08,640 --> 00:47:10,319
on the number pad to zoom into it i'm

1438
00:47:10,319 --> 00:47:12,000
going to tab into edit mode and scale it

1439
00:47:12,000 --> 00:47:14,560
on the z-axis so s and z

1440
00:47:14,560 --> 00:47:16,560
bring that down so what i'm making right

1441
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:18,160
now is one of the flower petals and then

1442
00:47:18,160 --> 00:47:20,079
once i've made the petal i'm going to

1443
00:47:20,079 --> 00:47:21,839
duplicate it and rotate it around so

1444
00:47:21,839 --> 00:47:23,920
that we have petals all around our

1445
00:47:23,920 --> 00:47:25,920
flower so i'm going to press 3 to go to

1446
00:47:25,920 --> 00:47:28,400
face select select this face and i'll

1447
00:47:28,400 --> 00:47:30,559
press g and click with my middle mouse

1448
00:47:30,559 --> 00:47:32,559
bring it out and then just scale it up a

1449
00:47:32,559 --> 00:47:34,160
little bit more just bring it out a

1450
00:47:34,160 --> 00:47:35,920
little bit farther something like that

1451
00:47:35,920 --> 00:47:37,280
maybe even a little bit farther and

1452
00:47:37,280 --> 00:47:39,440
scale it up a little bit okay i'll press

1453
00:47:39,440 --> 00:47:41,760
7 for top view now i'm going to press a

1454
00:47:41,760 --> 00:47:43,680
to select everything

1455
00:47:43,680 --> 00:47:46,400
g and move it over a bit and then now

1456
00:47:46,400 --> 00:47:47,599
that i've made one pedal i want to

1457
00:47:47,599 --> 00:47:50,000
duplicate the pedals and make them going

1458
00:47:50,000 --> 00:47:52,240
in a circle so i'll press shift d to

1459
00:47:52,240 --> 00:47:54,960
duplicate click right there r to rotate

1460
00:47:54,960 --> 00:47:57,040
just put it in place like that shift d

1461
00:47:57,040 --> 00:47:59,599
again r to rotate make this one right

1462
00:47:59,599 --> 00:48:02,400
there shift d again r to rotate bring

1463
00:48:02,400 --> 00:48:04,800
this one over here and then shift d

1464
00:48:04,800 --> 00:48:06,400
r to rotate

1465
00:48:06,400 --> 00:48:08,480
and then we'll add one more just give it

1466
00:48:08,480 --> 00:48:10,559
a little bit more space shift d

1467
00:48:10,559 --> 00:48:12,720
r and bring it in now you can see that

1468
00:48:12,720 --> 00:48:14,400
they're overlapping a little bit i don't

1469
00:48:14,400 --> 00:48:15,920
really mind that too much but if you

1470
00:48:15,920 --> 00:48:18,319
want to just press l and select some of

1471
00:48:18,319 --> 00:48:19,280
these

1472
00:48:19,280 --> 00:48:21,359
and just rotate them and kind of give it

1473
00:48:21,359 --> 00:48:23,359
a little bit more space there all right

1474
00:48:23,359 --> 00:48:24,880
now i want the center to be a little bit

1475
00:48:24,880 --> 00:48:26,640
smaller so i'm going to press 1 to go to

1476
00:48:26,640 --> 00:48:29,280
vertex z to move my mouse over and then

1477
00:48:29,280 --> 00:48:31,520
i'll just deselect everything i'll press

1478
00:48:31,520 --> 00:48:33,599
c for the circle select and just select

1479
00:48:33,599 --> 00:48:36,000
all of these and then just press s and

1480
00:48:36,000 --> 00:48:37,920
scale them down a little bit more all

1481
00:48:37,920 --> 00:48:39,359
right and then i want to bring this down

1482
00:48:39,359 --> 00:48:41,040
so i'll press g and z

1483
00:48:41,040 --> 00:48:43,200
bring it down i'm going to place my 3d

1484
00:48:43,200 --> 00:48:44,720
cursor right here and then i'll press

1485
00:48:44,720 --> 00:48:46,720
shift a and i'm going to search for

1486
00:48:46,720 --> 00:48:49,520
another circle i'll scale this circle

1487
00:48:49,520 --> 00:48:51,839
down just make it the size just make it

1488
00:48:51,839 --> 00:48:53,200
a little bit bigger so the petals are

1489
00:48:53,200 --> 00:48:54,960
kind of coming out of it and then i'll

1490
00:48:54,960 --> 00:48:57,520
press g and z bring it down

1491
00:48:57,520 --> 00:48:59,680
f to fill a face in there and then i'll

1492
00:48:59,680 --> 00:49:01,440
press e and z

1493
00:49:01,440 --> 00:49:04,960
just bring that up and then e and s and

1494
00:49:04,960 --> 00:49:07,119
then e and s again and then i think the

1495
00:49:07,119 --> 00:49:08,640
normals need to be recalculated so i'm

1496
00:49:08,640 --> 00:49:10,960
going to double tap a press shift n and

1497
00:49:10,960 --> 00:49:12,720
there we go now the normals are

1498
00:49:12,720 --> 00:49:14,720
recalculated now on the bottom here i

1499
00:49:14,720 --> 00:49:17,119
want to press e and then s

1500
00:49:17,119 --> 00:49:19,119
scale that down a little bit and then

1501
00:49:19,119 --> 00:49:21,119
i'm going to start to model these stem

1502
00:49:21,119 --> 00:49:22,880
so i'll press e and s

1503
00:49:22,880 --> 00:49:24,640
make that really small

1504
00:49:24,640 --> 00:49:25,680
and then e

1505
00:49:25,680 --> 00:49:26,720
and s

1506
00:49:26,720 --> 00:49:28,240
so it's going to be thin and then i'm

1507
00:49:28,240 --> 00:49:30,160
going to keep on extruding and making it

1508
00:49:30,160 --> 00:49:32,640
a little bit thicker as it goes more

1509
00:49:32,640 --> 00:49:34,240
towards the ground and then i want to

1510
00:49:34,240 --> 00:49:36,480
add some leaves so i'll press shift a

1511
00:49:36,480 --> 00:49:38,559
search for a cube

1512
00:49:38,559 --> 00:49:40,800
scale this cube down we're just going to

1513
00:49:40,800 --> 00:49:42,559
bring it over here

1514
00:49:42,559 --> 00:49:45,520
let's scale it down on the z axes

1515
00:49:45,520 --> 00:49:47,839
scale it up a little bit on the x

1516
00:49:47,839 --> 00:49:49,599
just put it into place i'm going to

1517
00:49:49,599 --> 00:49:51,359
press ctrl r right here and add a loop

1518
00:49:51,359 --> 00:49:53,359
cut in there and that way we can have if

1519
00:49:53,359 --> 00:49:55,280
this will actually go there we go click

1520
00:49:55,280 --> 00:49:57,280
right there i can press g and z bring

1521
00:49:57,280 --> 00:49:59,680
this down and that way we can have a

1522
00:49:59,680 --> 00:50:01,839
curve in the leaf so i want to add a

1523
00:50:01,839 --> 00:50:03,280
couple more vertices here so that we can

1524
00:50:03,280 --> 00:50:05,200
make the leaf thinner on the edges so

1525
00:50:05,200 --> 00:50:07,520
i'll press ctrl r i'm going to scroll up

1526
00:50:07,520 --> 00:50:09,280
with my mouse wheel to add two and then

1527
00:50:09,280 --> 00:50:11,920
just double tap to place those so now

1528
00:50:11,920 --> 00:50:14,079
what i can do is go into wireframe press

1529
00:50:14,079 --> 00:50:16,400
b and box select the front here press s

1530
00:50:16,400 --> 00:50:18,319
and scale it down and i'm actually going

1531
00:50:18,319 --> 00:50:20,640
to squish it all together so s and 0 and

1532
00:50:20,640 --> 00:50:22,960
then hit enter and again that auto merge

1533
00:50:22,960 --> 00:50:25,040
is going to merge that together alright

1534
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:26,319
so i want to select the other side of

1535
00:50:26,319 --> 00:50:28,400
the leaf and scale that down as well but

1536
00:50:28,400 --> 00:50:30,160
it's kind of coming through here so i'm

1537
00:50:30,160 --> 00:50:31,599
going to press l

1538
00:50:31,599 --> 00:50:33,280
to select the entire leaf with my mouse

1539
00:50:33,280 --> 00:50:36,079
hovered over it g to move this over and

1540
00:50:36,079 --> 00:50:38,400
then z to go into wireframe i'm just

1541
00:50:38,400 --> 00:50:39,359
going to

1542
00:50:39,359 --> 00:50:42,720
box select this and then e and then s

1543
00:50:42,720 --> 00:50:45,440
and then type in 0 and enter just bring

1544
00:50:45,440 --> 00:50:47,280
that out a little bit more all right so

1545
00:50:47,280 --> 00:50:49,119
the leaf is pretty straight right here

1546
00:50:49,119 --> 00:50:51,359
so i'm going to alt select this loop g

1547
00:50:51,359 --> 00:50:53,680
and z bring it down and then shift and

1548
00:50:53,680 --> 00:50:55,520
alt and select this loop and this loop

1549
00:50:55,520 --> 00:50:56,880
and g and z

1550
00:50:56,880 --> 00:50:59,200
bring it down so now the leaf is nice

1551
00:50:59,200 --> 00:51:01,520
and curved so if i tab into edit mode

1552
00:51:01,520 --> 00:51:04,400
now press l with my mouse over the leaf

1553
00:51:04,400 --> 00:51:06,319
it'll select the whole thing i can press

1554
00:51:06,319 --> 00:51:09,200
s and scale it up and then r to rotate

1555
00:51:09,200 --> 00:51:11,680
and just put it into place right there

1556
00:51:11,680 --> 00:51:13,200
and i think i'll also bring it up a

1557
00:51:13,200 --> 00:51:14,160
little bit

1558
00:51:14,160 --> 00:51:16,559
and maybe scale it a little bit bigger

1559
00:51:16,559 --> 00:51:17,760
and then i think i'll make another one

1560
00:51:17,760 --> 00:51:19,680
so i'll press shift d duplicate it bring

1561
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:20,800
it over

1562
00:51:20,800 --> 00:51:23,760
r to rotate you can also double tap r

1563
00:51:23,760 --> 00:51:25,359
and that will kind of do the trackball

1564
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,040
rotation

1565
00:51:27,040 --> 00:51:29,520
and just stick it into place and there

1566
00:51:29,520 --> 00:51:32,240
we go we have our first flower modeled

1567
00:51:32,240 --> 00:51:34,240
so let's add some materials so i'm going

1568
00:51:34,240 --> 00:51:36,079
to click right here and first add the

1569
00:51:36,079 --> 00:51:37,839
green material let's go into rendered

1570
00:51:37,839 --> 00:51:39,359
mode so we can see what that's looking

1571
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:41,440
like now i want it to be yellow in here

1572
00:51:41,440 --> 00:51:43,680
and then out here i want to be random

1573
00:51:43,680 --> 00:51:45,839
colors depending on what flower it is

1574
00:51:45,839 --> 00:51:47,200
and real quick it looks like something's

1575
00:51:47,200 --> 00:51:49,119
wrong with the modeling here you can see

1576
00:51:49,119 --> 00:51:50,559
that there is a little bit of space in

1577
00:51:50,559 --> 00:51:52,319
there there's a little gap so i can

1578
00:51:52,319 --> 00:51:54,800
press three to go to the face select and

1579
00:51:54,800 --> 00:51:57,119
then shift select these faces and then i

1580
00:51:57,119 --> 00:51:58,559
can press g

1581
00:51:58,559 --> 00:52:00,400
and push them in so i need to just

1582
00:52:00,400 --> 00:52:02,480
select the area that i want to be yellow

1583
00:52:02,480 --> 00:52:03,839
so i'm going to hold down the alt key

1584
00:52:03,839 --> 00:52:05,440
select this loop and then hold down the

1585
00:52:05,440 --> 00:52:07,920
shift and alt key and select this loop

1586
00:52:07,920 --> 00:52:09,200
and then just hold down the shift key

1587
00:52:09,200 --> 00:52:11,280
and select this one now i can click on

1588
00:52:11,280 --> 00:52:13,839
the plus right here click on new i'm

1589
00:52:13,839 --> 00:52:17,440
going to call this material yellow

1590
00:52:17,440 --> 00:52:19,119
and then on the base color i'm just

1591
00:52:19,119 --> 00:52:21,599
going to make this yellow and then click

1592
00:52:21,599 --> 00:52:23,280
on a sign so i want it to be kind of a

1593
00:52:23,280 --> 00:52:26,000
yellowy orangey color pretty saturated

1594
00:52:26,000 --> 00:52:27,839
okay so now i need to

1595
00:52:27,839 --> 00:52:29,839
click on one of the petals press l and

1596
00:52:29,839 --> 00:52:32,319
just go around pressing l with my mouse

1597
00:52:32,319 --> 00:52:34,400
over the petals to select all of them

1598
00:52:34,400 --> 00:52:36,240
i'm going to click on the plus

1599
00:52:36,240 --> 00:52:38,319
click on new and i'm going to call this

1600
00:52:38,319 --> 00:52:40,079
flowers or petals or whatever you want

1601
00:52:40,079 --> 00:52:41,760
to call it and then i'm going to press

1602
00:52:41,760 --> 00:52:44,800
on assign and now it's the white flowers

1603
00:52:44,800 --> 00:52:46,400
now when i duplicate the flowers i want

1604
00:52:46,400 --> 00:52:48,559
them to randomly be different colors so

1605
00:52:48,559 --> 00:52:49,680
to do this i'm going to go to the

1606
00:52:49,680 --> 00:52:51,119
shading tab

1607
00:52:51,119 --> 00:52:52,559
zoom out here and you can see here's our

1608
00:52:52,559 --> 00:52:55,920
shader nodes and i need to pan over here

1609
00:52:55,920 --> 00:52:57,599
so i can see the flower

1610
00:52:57,599 --> 00:53:00,079
okay i'm going to press shift a and i'm

1611
00:53:00,079 --> 00:53:03,280
going to add the object info node click

1612
00:53:03,280 --> 00:53:05,599
on this drop it over here the random

1613
00:53:05,599 --> 00:53:07,680
value i'm going to plug into the base

1614
00:53:07,680 --> 00:53:09,760
color so now i need to tell it what

1615
00:53:09,760 --> 00:53:11,200
colors are going to be randomly

1616
00:53:11,200 --> 00:53:13,680
generated so i'm going to press shift a

1617
00:53:13,680 --> 00:53:16,160
search for a color ramp just drop the

1618
00:53:16,160 --> 00:53:18,800
color ramp right in here and then you

1619
00:53:18,800 --> 00:53:20,400
can see this fades in between the

1620
00:53:20,400 --> 00:53:21,920
different colors i don't want to fade in

1621
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:23,040
between the colors i just want there to

1622
00:53:23,040 --> 00:53:25,200
be specific colors so instead of linear

1623
00:53:25,200 --> 00:53:26,640
i'm going to click right here and turn

1624
00:53:26,640 --> 00:53:29,280
it to constant and now there's no fading

1625
00:53:29,280 --> 00:53:31,040
in between the colors it's just constant

1626
00:53:31,040 --> 00:53:33,200
colors from black to white or whatever

1627
00:53:33,200 --> 00:53:35,359
colors we're going to add so now we can

1628
00:53:35,359 --> 00:53:37,839
do is just bring this over i want some

1629
00:53:37,839 --> 00:53:39,359
of the flowers to be white so i'll just

1630
00:53:39,359 --> 00:53:41,440
leave that at white the black here i'm

1631
00:53:41,440 --> 00:53:44,079
going to turn this to a red color so

1632
00:53:44,079 --> 00:53:46,000
bring it up make it nice and red not

1633
00:53:46,000 --> 00:53:48,240
super saturated but pretty saturated and

1634
00:53:48,240 --> 00:53:49,200
then i'm just going to actually

1635
00:53:49,200 --> 00:53:50,960
duplicate a bunch of flowers just so

1636
00:53:50,960 --> 00:53:52,480
that we can see what this is looking

1637
00:53:52,480 --> 00:53:54,640
like so press shift d

1638
00:53:54,640 --> 00:53:56,480
duplicate a bunch of flowers and you can

1639
00:53:56,480 --> 00:53:58,160
see that however much of the color there

1640
00:53:58,160 --> 00:54:00,480
is it's more likely that it's going to

1641
00:54:00,480 --> 00:54:02,559
be generated as that color so i can just

1642
00:54:02,559 --> 00:54:04,559
change this if i want most of them to be

1643
00:54:04,559 --> 00:54:06,640
white i could do that i'm just going to

1644
00:54:06,640 --> 00:54:08,319
bring this down though okay i'll click

1645
00:54:08,319 --> 00:54:10,240
on the plus button add a new one this

1646
00:54:10,240 --> 00:54:12,240
one i'm going to make a purpley color

1647
00:54:12,240 --> 00:54:14,240
and then again change the size because

1648
00:54:14,240 --> 00:54:16,640
the size is going to determine how often

1649
00:54:16,640 --> 00:54:18,480
it's going to be that color i'll click

1650
00:54:18,480 --> 00:54:19,760
on plus again

1651
00:54:19,760 --> 00:54:21,920
move this one over here and then this

1652
00:54:21,920 --> 00:54:23,520
one i'm going to have a really bright

1653
00:54:23,520 --> 00:54:24,800
yellow color

1654
00:54:24,800 --> 00:54:26,559
like that i'll bring these in a little

1655
00:54:26,559 --> 00:54:27,920
bit more and then i want to add one more

1656
00:54:27,920 --> 00:54:30,319
in here so i'll click on the plus button

1657
00:54:30,319 --> 00:54:32,400
and this one i'm going to change to a

1658
00:54:32,400 --> 00:54:34,880
pink color and then to make that purple

1659
00:54:34,880 --> 00:54:36,880
look a little bit different kind of more

1660
00:54:36,880 --> 00:54:38,160
contrasty i'm going to make that purple

1661
00:54:38,160 --> 00:54:40,160
a bit darker and a bit more blue so

1662
00:54:40,160 --> 00:54:41,920
there we go now if i just duplicate

1663
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:44,240
these you can see they're just randomly

1664
00:54:44,240 --> 00:54:46,400
being generated with different colors so

1665
00:54:46,400 --> 00:54:47,520
i'm just going to select all these

1666
00:54:47,520 --> 00:54:50,480
except one press x and delete them so

1667
00:54:50,480 --> 00:54:52,720
this one i need to scale down and let's

1668
00:54:52,720 --> 00:54:54,079
just go back into the layout so we have

1669
00:54:54,079 --> 00:54:56,400
some more space so i'll scale this down

1670
00:54:56,400 --> 00:54:58,480
to the size that i want just place it

1671
00:54:58,480 --> 00:55:00,000
down there and then i don't want the

1672
00:55:00,000 --> 00:55:01,839
flower to be pointed straight up i kind

1673
00:55:01,839 --> 00:55:03,440
of want it to be sagging a little bit so

1674
00:55:03,440 --> 00:55:05,040
i'll just have an edit mode

1675
00:55:05,040 --> 00:55:08,079
z for wireframe one for vertex select

1676
00:55:08,079 --> 00:55:10,240
just box select an area and just rotate

1677
00:55:10,240 --> 00:55:12,640
it give it a random rotation just like

1678
00:55:12,640 --> 00:55:14,640
that okay let's duplicate this and we

1679
00:55:14,640 --> 00:55:16,799
can make some more flowers so this one

1680
00:55:16,799 --> 00:55:18,799
here i'm just going to press l and just

1681
00:55:18,799 --> 00:55:21,680
select that leaf and press x and delete

1682
00:55:21,680 --> 00:55:24,319
vertices and now that just has one leaf

1683
00:55:24,319 --> 00:55:25,839
and then i think i'll just give it a

1684
00:55:25,839 --> 00:55:27,119
random

1685
00:55:27,119 --> 00:55:28,640
rotation so maybe this one's going to be

1686
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,880
rotating over like this okay there we go

1687
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:32,000
and then i'll make one more so i'll

1688
00:55:32,000 --> 00:55:34,799
click on this shift d bring it over here

1689
00:55:34,799 --> 00:55:36,799
that's a purple one and then this one

1690
00:55:36,799 --> 00:55:38,720
again just rotate it give it a random

1691
00:55:38,720 --> 00:55:40,799
rotation and then this one i want there

1692
00:55:40,799 --> 00:55:42,640
to be two leaves but i think i'll change

1693
00:55:42,640 --> 00:55:45,040
the position of the leaf so i'll press l

1694
00:55:45,040 --> 00:55:47,200
to select all the linked vertices

1695
00:55:47,200 --> 00:55:48,480
are to rotate

1696
00:55:48,480 --> 00:55:50,160
just rotate it

1697
00:55:50,160 --> 00:55:52,240
where you want about like that maybe

1698
00:55:52,240 --> 00:55:54,400
rotate it over a bit more scale it down

1699
00:55:54,400 --> 00:55:57,280
a little bit and there we go so there is

1700
00:55:57,280 --> 00:55:59,599
the finished flowers all right let's

1701
00:55:59,599 --> 00:56:01,280
make the low poly rocks now so i'm going

1702
00:56:01,280 --> 00:56:02,640
to press shift a

1703
00:56:02,640 --> 00:56:04,319
and i'm going to start with an ico

1704
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,079
sphere and then on the ecosphere

1705
00:56:06,079 --> 00:56:07,280
settings right down here i'm going to

1706
00:56:07,280 --> 00:56:08,880
set these to 5 so it's a little bit

1707
00:56:08,880 --> 00:56:11,359
higher and that way we can shape the

1708
00:56:11,359 --> 00:56:13,040
rocks how we want so i'm just going to

1709
00:56:13,040 --> 00:56:15,119
scale it down just press period on the

1710
00:56:15,119 --> 00:56:17,520
number pad to zoom into it i'll tap into

1711
00:56:17,520 --> 00:56:19,760
edit mode and then i need to press o to

1712
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:21,280
turn on proportional editing and then

1713
00:56:21,280 --> 00:56:22,480
i'll press g

1714
00:56:22,480 --> 00:56:24,799
and just make the shape of the rock so

1715
00:56:24,799 --> 00:56:26,799
just make it however you want rocks are

1716
00:56:26,799 --> 00:56:28,480
usually pretty random although i do find

1717
00:56:28,480 --> 00:56:30,240
that rocks are usually kind of flat on

1718
00:56:30,240 --> 00:56:31,920
the bottom of them so i'm going to make

1719
00:56:31,920 --> 00:56:34,480
the bottom of the rock pretty flat where

1720
00:56:34,480 --> 00:56:37,280
it's going into the ground and then once

1721
00:56:37,280 --> 00:56:39,280
you've made a rock i'll click on the

1722
00:56:39,280 --> 00:56:41,119
modifiers right here click on add

1723
00:56:41,119 --> 00:56:43,359
modifier and i'm going to add the

1724
00:56:43,359 --> 00:56:46,000
decimate modifier just bring the ratio

1725
00:56:46,000 --> 00:56:48,799
down until it's at a value that you like

1726
00:56:48,799 --> 00:56:50,000
and then i'm going to make four

1727
00:56:50,000 --> 00:56:52,319
different rocks so i will bring this one

1728
00:56:52,319 --> 00:56:54,400
down a little bit into the ground and

1729
00:56:54,400 --> 00:56:56,319
then i'll press shift d click with my

1730
00:56:56,319 --> 00:56:58,480
middle mouse wheel bring this over tab

1731
00:56:58,480 --> 00:57:00,400
in edit mode i'm just going to

1732
00:57:00,400 --> 00:57:02,559
select some points now this rock i think

1733
00:57:02,559 --> 00:57:04,240
i want to be a little bit longer or

1734
00:57:04,240 --> 00:57:06,400
higher up so i'm going to bring that up

1735
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,319
there we go looks very cool

1736
00:57:08,319 --> 00:57:10,400
shifty click with my middle mouse wheel

1737
00:57:10,400 --> 00:57:12,400
maybe give it a random rotation

1738
00:57:12,400 --> 00:57:14,240
this one maybe i'll make a super flat

1739
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:16,960
rock there we go maybe just change the

1740
00:57:16,960 --> 00:57:19,040
shape of it a little bit and then i'll

1741
00:57:19,040 --> 00:57:20,640
press shift d

1742
00:57:20,640 --> 00:57:22,880
bring this over make one more rock just

1743
00:57:22,880 --> 00:57:24,559
like that alright so then once you're

1744
00:57:24,559 --> 00:57:26,400
happy with the shape of the rock you can

1745
00:57:26,400 --> 00:57:28,720
press ctrl a with your mouse over the

1746
00:57:28,720 --> 00:57:31,520
modifier and just apply all of the

1747
00:57:31,520 --> 00:57:33,680
decimate modifiers let's add a material

1748
00:57:33,680 --> 00:57:35,599
to these rocks so i will click on the

1749
00:57:35,599 --> 00:57:37,920
materials panel click on new let's go

1750
00:57:37,920 --> 00:57:39,680
into rendered view i'm going to call

1751
00:57:39,680 --> 00:57:42,160
this material rock and then on the base

1752
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,559
color i'll make this a bit gray

1753
00:57:44,559 --> 00:57:46,559
and then on the roughness you could turn

1754
00:57:46,559 --> 00:57:48,640
it down a little bit if you like that if

1755
00:57:48,640 --> 00:57:50,000
you like the look of that you could also

1756
00:57:50,000 --> 00:57:52,319
turn it up just a little bit and then to

1757
00:57:52,319 --> 00:57:53,920
drop this onto the other rocks i can

1758
00:57:53,920 --> 00:57:56,640
just click and drag and drop that on to

1759
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,400
the other rocks

1760
00:57:58,400 --> 00:58:00,319
and then i'm going to select these rocks

1761
00:58:00,319 --> 00:58:02,000
scale them down a little bit and bring

1762
00:58:02,000 --> 00:58:04,480
them over to the side now let's model

1763
00:58:04,480 --> 00:58:06,640
the grass so to model the grass i'm

1764
00:58:06,640 --> 00:58:08,160
going to press shift a and i'm going to

1765
00:58:08,160 --> 00:58:10,400
start off with a cube

1766
00:58:10,400 --> 00:58:12,000
scale the cube down

1767
00:58:12,000 --> 00:58:13,680
bring it over here

1768
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:15,680
just bring it into place i'll tap into

1769
00:58:15,680 --> 00:58:17,920
edit mode and scale it down you can see

1770
00:58:17,920 --> 00:58:19,520
that it the proportional editing is on

1771
00:58:19,520 --> 00:58:21,440
again so i'll turn that off i'll scale

1772
00:58:21,440 --> 00:58:23,520
the whole thing down on the x-axis

1773
00:58:23,520 --> 00:58:25,520
so that it's a lot thinner and then also

1774
00:58:25,520 --> 00:58:27,599
scale it down on the y-axis a bit i'll

1775
00:58:27,599 --> 00:58:29,760
press three to go to the face select and

1776
00:58:29,760 --> 00:58:31,760
then e to extrude and just start to

1777
00:58:31,760 --> 00:58:33,920
extrude out those grass blades now that

1778
00:58:33,920 --> 00:58:35,839
grass blade is way too big so i'm going

1779
00:58:35,839 --> 00:58:37,920
to scale it a lot more down and then

1780
00:58:37,920 --> 00:58:39,680
let's tab back into edit mode scale it

1781
00:58:39,680 --> 00:58:41,200
way down now at the very tip here i want

1782
00:58:41,200 --> 00:58:43,599
to scale this down to zero so i'll press

1783
00:58:43,599 --> 00:58:44,319
s

1784
00:58:44,319 --> 00:58:46,799
0 and enter and there we go now the

1785
00:58:46,799 --> 00:58:48,799
point is very sharp so that's one grass

1786
00:58:48,799 --> 00:58:50,559
blade let's press shifty and duplicate

1787
00:58:50,559 --> 00:58:52,400
this bring it over and let's make a few

1788
00:58:52,400 --> 00:58:53,839
more so i'm gonna make four different

1789
00:58:53,839 --> 00:58:55,280
grass blades and then i'll use those

1790
00:58:55,280 --> 00:58:57,200
grass blades to make some bunches of

1791
00:58:57,200 --> 00:59:00,079
grass so this next one i think i will

1792
00:59:00,079 --> 00:59:02,400
box select it and make it really long

1793
00:59:02,400 --> 00:59:04,880
and straight just like that okay

1794
00:59:04,880 --> 00:59:06,720
duplicate this again bring it over and

1795
00:59:06,720 --> 00:59:08,799
this one i'm going to make it so it's

1796
00:59:08,799 --> 00:59:11,520
rotating over a lot and a bit smaller

1797
00:59:11,520 --> 00:59:12,799
i'll also add a loop cut in here by

1798
00:59:12,799 --> 00:59:15,599
pressing ctrl r double tap to place that

1799
00:59:15,599 --> 00:59:18,079
and then just bring that up maybe bring

1800
00:59:18,079 --> 00:59:19,760
that down a little bit more and then i'm

1801
00:59:19,760 --> 00:59:21,520
going to select this one press shift d

1802
00:59:21,520 --> 00:59:22,880
bring it over and i'll just make one

1803
00:59:22,880 --> 00:59:24,720
more grass blade this one's going to be

1804
00:59:24,720 --> 00:59:26,480
just kind of a basic one just going

1805
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:27,839
straight up maybe it's going to be

1806
00:59:27,839 --> 00:59:30,319
waving a little bit so down here it'll

1807
00:59:30,319 --> 00:59:32,000
kind of go up and then over to the side

1808
00:59:32,000 --> 00:59:33,680
and then back all right so now that we

1809
00:59:33,680 --> 00:59:35,839
have these four grass blades i'm going

1810
00:59:35,839 --> 00:59:37,280
to click on this

1811
00:59:37,280 --> 00:59:39,520
add the green material but grass is

1812
00:59:39,520 --> 00:59:41,040
usually a little bit more reflective a

1813
00:59:41,040 --> 00:59:42,640
little bit more shiny so i'm going to

1814
00:59:42,640 --> 00:59:44,799
click on this to duplicate the material

1815
00:59:44,799 --> 00:59:46,960
call it grass and then i'm going to

1816
00:59:46,960 --> 00:59:49,440
click and drag just drop the color on to

1817
00:59:49,440 --> 00:59:51,760
the other grass blades so now what i can

1818
00:59:51,760 --> 00:59:53,599
do is go down to the roughness turn the

1819
00:59:53,599 --> 00:59:55,359
roughness down a little bit and now if i

1820
00:59:55,359 --> 00:59:56,880
go into rendered mode and look around

1821
00:59:56,880 --> 00:59:58,319
the grass will just be a little bit more

1822
00:59:58,319 --> 01:00:00,240
reflective so now i want to make some

1823
01:00:00,240 --> 01:00:02,480
bunches of grass i'm going to just kind

1824
01:00:02,480 --> 01:00:04,559
of rotate these bunch them all up

1825
01:00:04,559 --> 01:00:06,799
together put this one in here i'm going

1826
01:00:06,799 --> 01:00:08,880
to make four different bunches of grass

1827
01:00:08,880 --> 01:00:10,559
and then i can select some pieces of

1828
01:00:10,559 --> 01:00:12,640
grass press shift d to duplicate it give

1829
01:00:12,640 --> 01:00:14,559
them a random rotation

1830
01:00:14,559 --> 01:00:16,640
just have them sticking out just like

1831
01:00:16,640 --> 01:00:18,720
that all right so that's going to be my

1832
01:00:18,720 --> 01:00:20,880
first clump of grass so what i'm going

1833
01:00:20,880 --> 01:00:23,280
to do now is hold down the shift key

1834
01:00:23,280 --> 01:00:25,040
just select all the different pieces of

1835
01:00:25,040 --> 01:00:27,839
grass and press ctrl j and that'll join

1836
01:00:27,839 --> 01:00:30,079
them together and now we have one clump

1837
01:00:30,079 --> 01:00:32,240
of grass so i want to make four so this

1838
01:00:32,240 --> 01:00:33,839
is going to kind of be a medium sized

1839
01:00:33,839 --> 01:00:35,839
one i'll press shift d click with my

1840
01:00:35,839 --> 01:00:37,920
middle mouse move over i want to make a

1841
01:00:37,920 --> 01:00:39,680
bigger clump of grass so i'll tap into

1842
01:00:39,680 --> 01:00:42,319
edit mode just select everything with a

1843
01:00:42,319 --> 01:00:44,160
and press shift d

1844
01:00:44,160 --> 01:00:47,280
bring this over and then press r and z

1845
01:00:47,280 --> 01:00:48,960
and give it a random rotation kind of

1846
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:50,559
have it sticking out

1847
01:00:50,559 --> 01:00:52,799
kind of rotate that and then i will

1848
01:00:52,799 --> 01:00:55,119
press shift d again rotate that give it

1849
01:00:55,119 --> 01:00:57,040
a random rotation and i want a little

1850
01:00:57,040 --> 01:00:58,720
bit more of the grass to be curved over

1851
01:00:58,720 --> 01:01:00,480
so i can just manually

1852
01:01:00,480 --> 01:01:03,359
go into edit mode here just rotate some

1853
01:01:03,359 --> 01:01:05,280
of the grass pieces

1854
01:01:05,280 --> 01:01:06,960
because i think some of the grass pieces

1855
01:01:06,960 --> 01:01:08,960
should be rotated over a bit more all

1856
01:01:08,960 --> 01:01:11,119
right and there is my second clump of

1857
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:13,280
grass so now i want to make two more i

1858
01:01:13,280 --> 01:01:14,640
want to make one that's really small and

1859
01:01:14,640 --> 01:01:16,079
then one's just just a little bit

1860
01:01:16,079 --> 01:01:18,240
smaller so i'll press shift d bring this

1861
01:01:18,240 --> 01:01:20,559
over duplicate that tab and edit mode

1862
01:01:20,559 --> 01:01:22,720
i'm just going to select some random

1863
01:01:22,720 --> 01:01:24,720
pieces of grass press l

1864
01:01:24,720 --> 01:01:26,640
and just select some of them and then

1865
01:01:26,640 --> 01:01:28,799
i'll press x and delete vertices so now

1866
01:01:28,799 --> 01:01:30,799
we have a smaller lump of grass and

1867
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,079
again i'm just going to play with the

1868
01:01:32,079 --> 01:01:33,680
shape a little bit just to make it look

1869
01:01:33,680 --> 01:01:35,760
a little bit nicer all right there's my

1870
01:01:35,760 --> 01:01:37,280
third piece of grass i'll just make one

1871
01:01:37,280 --> 01:01:39,440
more so i'll select this one shift d

1872
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:41,040
click with my middle mouse wheel bring

1873
01:01:41,040 --> 01:01:43,119
this over and then this one i just want

1874
01:01:43,119 --> 01:01:45,599
to be three pieces of grass so i'll just

1875
01:01:45,599 --> 01:01:46,799
press l

1876
01:01:46,799 --> 01:01:48,640
and select a couple and press x and

1877
01:01:48,640 --> 01:01:50,799
delete them and now i just have a very

1878
01:01:50,799 --> 01:01:52,640
small clump of grass and i think i'll

1879
01:01:52,640 --> 01:01:54,480
press l to select this one and bring it

1880
01:01:54,480 --> 01:01:56,079
in a little bit more there's our grass

1881
01:01:56,079 --> 01:01:57,359
looking pretty good now i do want to

1882
01:01:57,359 --> 01:01:59,280
play around with the colors a little bit

1883
01:01:59,280 --> 01:02:00,880
so i'm going to go back to the shading

1884
01:02:00,880 --> 01:02:02,880
tab so i just want to play around with

1885
01:02:02,880 --> 01:02:04,000
some of the colors i think i'll make

1886
01:02:04,000 --> 01:02:05,920
this a little bit darker this one i

1887
01:02:05,920 --> 01:02:07,200
think i'll make a little bit more

1888
01:02:07,200 --> 01:02:09,200
saturated and if you wanted to you could

1889
01:02:09,200 --> 01:02:10,799
also add some more colors like i'm going

1890
01:02:10,799 --> 01:02:12,720
to add a color in here and make this one

1891
01:02:12,720 --> 01:02:14,720
a little bit more yellow and generally i

1892
01:02:14,720 --> 01:02:15,920
think it would look a little bit better

1893
01:02:15,920 --> 01:02:17,599
if the grass were a little bit darker so

1894
01:02:17,599 --> 01:02:19,680
i'm just selecting some of these points

1895
01:02:19,680 --> 01:02:20,799
and then clicking on the color and

1896
01:02:20,799 --> 01:02:22,720
making them a little bit darker so there

1897
01:02:22,720 --> 01:02:25,440
we go there is our finished grass clumps

1898
01:02:25,440 --> 01:02:26,880
so now let's go ahead and make the

1899
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:28,640
bushes so i'm just going to place my 3d

1900
01:02:28,640 --> 01:02:30,799
cursor right here i'll press shift a and

1901
01:02:30,799 --> 01:02:33,359
i'm going to add another icosphere now

1902
01:02:33,359 --> 01:02:34,960
this psychosphere on the ecosphere

1903
01:02:34,960 --> 01:02:35,760
settings i want to turn these

1904
01:02:35,760 --> 01:02:38,000
subdivisions all the way down to one so

1905
01:02:38,000 --> 01:02:40,160
it's very low poly and then i'll just

1906
01:02:40,160 --> 01:02:42,720
scale this down now on the bottom here i

1907
01:02:42,720 --> 01:02:44,319
don't want this to be pointed way down i

1908
01:02:44,319 --> 01:02:45,440
want it to be kind of flat because it's

1909
01:02:45,440 --> 01:02:47,039
just going in the ground so i'll just

1910
01:02:47,039 --> 01:02:49,440
select this vertice and make it nice and

1911
01:02:49,440 --> 01:02:51,280
flat and then i can just bring the

1912
01:02:51,280 --> 01:02:53,680
entire bush up i'll add a new material

1913
01:02:53,680 --> 01:02:55,839
and add that green color and then i'll

1914
01:02:55,839 --> 01:02:57,520
tab into edit mode select everything

1915
01:02:57,520 --> 01:02:59,920
with a and press shift d and just scale

1916
01:02:59,920 --> 01:03:01,440
this down and what i'm going gonna do is

1917
01:03:01,440 --> 01:03:04,400
make little clumps of bushes around the

1918
01:03:04,400 --> 01:03:07,359
big bush so just move these around press

1919
01:03:07,359 --> 01:03:09,520
shift d scale them up a little bit just

1920
01:03:09,520 --> 01:03:11,680
give them some random scale and just

1921
01:03:11,680 --> 01:03:14,400
place them around the main bush all

1922
01:03:14,400 --> 01:03:15,680
right there we go now i want to do the

1923
01:03:15,680 --> 01:03:17,200
same thing but this time i only want to

1924
01:03:17,200 --> 01:03:19,599
have two clumps so i'll press shift d

1925
01:03:19,599 --> 01:03:21,200
click with my middle mouse wheel bring

1926
01:03:21,200 --> 01:03:22,240
this over

1927
01:03:22,240 --> 01:03:24,720
and then i'll tab into edit mode press l

1928
01:03:24,720 --> 01:03:26,960
and l to select these and then press x

1929
01:03:26,960 --> 01:03:29,839
and delete vertices and then this one i

1930
01:03:29,839 --> 01:03:31,440
think i want this one to be a little bit

1931
01:03:31,440 --> 01:03:33,599
bigger and then this one maybe just a

1932
01:03:33,599 --> 01:03:35,039
little bit smaller maybe give that a

1933
01:03:35,039 --> 01:03:37,119
random rotation but there we go there is

1934
01:03:37,119 --> 01:03:39,920
our finished low poly bushes and our low

1935
01:03:39,920 --> 01:03:41,920
poly acids are really coming together i

1936
01:03:41,920 --> 01:03:43,280
do want to make some mushrooms though

1937
01:03:43,280 --> 01:03:44,319
and i'm going to make two different

1938
01:03:44,319 --> 01:03:45,839
types of mushrooms so i'm going to make

1939
01:03:45,839 --> 01:03:48,000
a brown mushroom and a red mushroom so

1940
01:03:48,000 --> 01:03:50,000
let's do the brown mushroom first so

1941
01:03:50,000 --> 01:03:51,839
i'll press shift a and once again i'm

1942
01:03:51,839 --> 01:03:54,240
going to add a circle just make sure the

1943
01:03:54,240 --> 01:03:56,240
circle settings is set to 8 and then

1944
01:03:56,240 --> 01:03:58,480
we'll scale it way down tap into edit

1945
01:03:58,480 --> 01:04:00,079
mode and i'm going to press f to fill

1946
01:04:00,079 --> 01:04:02,319
that i'll press 1 to go to side view so

1947
01:04:02,319 --> 01:04:03,680
that we can see that a little bit better

1948
01:04:03,680 --> 01:04:06,000
and i'll press z and go into wireframe

1949
01:04:06,000 --> 01:04:07,599
so now what i can do is just extrude

1950
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:10,160
this with e and s and scale that down

1951
01:04:10,160 --> 01:04:12,079
and basically just make the shape of the

1952
01:04:12,079 --> 01:04:14,720
stem for the mushroom and i don't want

1953
01:04:14,720 --> 01:04:16,319
it to be too thick so maybe make it a

1954
01:04:16,319 --> 01:04:17,839
little bit thinner okay i'm going to

1955
01:04:17,839 --> 01:04:20,480
press e and s make that a lot bigger and

1956
01:04:20,480 --> 01:04:22,559
then just bring that down a little bit

1957
01:04:22,559 --> 01:04:25,359
okay i'll press e and s scale that up g

1958
01:04:25,359 --> 01:04:27,280
and z bring it up a little bit and then

1959
01:04:27,280 --> 01:04:29,440
i'll press e bring that up scale it down

1960
01:04:29,440 --> 01:04:31,760
just a little bit and then e

1961
01:04:31,760 --> 01:04:33,760
bring that up scale it down we're

1962
01:04:33,760 --> 01:04:35,280
basically just making the shape of the

1963
01:04:35,280 --> 01:04:36,400
mushroom

1964
01:04:36,400 --> 01:04:38,160
and then e and s

1965
01:04:38,160 --> 01:04:39,680
and then the face is already filled

1966
01:04:39,680 --> 01:04:41,280
right up there so there we go that's

1967
01:04:41,280 --> 01:04:42,799
looking pretty good but the stem is

1968
01:04:42,799 --> 01:04:44,960
really big so i'm going to press c go

1969
01:04:44,960 --> 01:04:47,280
into wireframe just box select the top

1970
01:04:47,280 --> 01:04:49,119
here and scale it up and make it a lot

1971
01:04:49,119 --> 01:04:50,000
bigger

1972
01:04:50,000 --> 01:04:51,599
because right now the stem is way too

1973
01:04:51,599 --> 01:04:54,079
big compared to the top of our mushroom

1974
01:04:54,079 --> 01:04:55,920
i'm also going to alt select this loop

1975
01:04:55,920 --> 01:04:58,559
down here scale it down and then press g

1976
01:04:58,559 --> 01:05:00,480
and z and bring it up a bit let's make

1977
01:05:00,480 --> 01:05:02,240
the materials for our mushrooms now so

1978
01:05:02,240 --> 01:05:04,000
i'll click on new i'm going to call this

1979
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:05,760
stem because this is going to be the

1980
01:05:05,760 --> 01:05:07,520
stem of the mushroom and i'm going to

1981
01:05:07,520 --> 01:05:08,720
make this

1982
01:05:08,720 --> 01:05:11,119
a lighter brown color

1983
01:05:11,119 --> 01:05:12,559
and i'm going to turn up the roughness

1984
01:05:12,559 --> 01:05:14,319
because i don't want it to be very rough

1985
01:05:14,319 --> 01:05:15,920
just something like that and now i'll

1986
01:05:15,920 --> 01:05:18,319
tap into edit mode press 3 for the face

1987
01:05:18,319 --> 01:05:20,559
select and just alt select some of these

1988
01:05:20,559 --> 01:05:22,720
vertices just that we have the top of

1989
01:05:22,720 --> 01:05:24,480
the mushroom selected now i'm going to

1990
01:05:24,480 --> 01:05:26,640
click on the plus here click on new i'm

1991
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,200
going to call this one mushroom and then

1992
01:05:29,200 --> 01:05:31,520
click on a sign now this one i want to

1993
01:05:31,520 --> 01:05:34,319
be a much darker color not super dark

1994
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,319
but definitely darker and then i want to

1995
01:05:36,319 --> 01:05:38,720
turn the roughness up quite a bit and

1996
01:05:38,720 --> 01:05:39,920
then i want to add a little bit more

1997
01:05:39,920 --> 01:05:41,599
vertices in here so i'll tab into edit

1998
01:05:41,599 --> 01:05:43,760
mode press 1 for the vertex select and

1999
01:05:43,760 --> 01:05:45,359
just alt select this face and i can

2000
01:05:45,359 --> 01:05:47,760
press ctrl b add a bevel in there that

2001
01:05:47,760 --> 01:05:48,880
way there's just a little bit more

2002
01:05:48,880 --> 01:05:50,480
vertices i could also

2003
01:05:50,480 --> 01:05:52,720
select these and double tap g and edge

2004
01:05:52,720 --> 01:05:54,480
slide them up a bit and then right here

2005
01:05:54,480 --> 01:05:56,000
i think i want to add a bevel right here

2006
01:05:56,000 --> 01:05:58,480
so i'll alt select this control b just

2007
01:05:58,480 --> 01:06:00,880
make a little bevel just like that all

2008
01:06:00,880 --> 01:06:02,640
right let's make this mushroom bend over

2009
01:06:02,640 --> 01:06:05,280
a little bit so i'll tab in edit mode z

2010
01:06:05,280 --> 01:06:07,839
move my mouse over just box select this

2011
01:06:07,839 --> 01:06:10,240
and rotate it a little bit g to grab and

2012
01:06:10,240 --> 01:06:12,240
then press b for the box select but i'm

2013
01:06:12,240 --> 01:06:13,680
going to click with my middle mouse

2014
01:06:13,680 --> 01:06:16,240
wheel to deselect that area and then

2015
01:06:16,240 --> 01:06:18,319
just rotate that over a little bit okay

2016
01:06:18,319 --> 01:06:19,760
looking pretty good i want to duplicate

2017
01:06:19,760 --> 01:06:20,880
this and make just a couple more

2018
01:06:20,880 --> 01:06:23,359
mushrooms so this mushroom i want it to

2019
01:06:23,359 --> 01:06:25,680
be rotated maybe the other way so i can

2020
01:06:25,680 --> 01:06:27,680
just rotate that over maybe scale this

2021
01:06:27,680 --> 01:06:29,599
one up a bit so that it's a little bit

2022
01:06:29,599 --> 01:06:32,079
bigger and then also just rotate it down

2023
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:34,240
a little bit just like that and then one

2024
01:06:34,240 --> 01:06:36,240
more mushroom i'm gonna select this one

2025
01:06:36,240 --> 01:06:38,319
press shift d click with my middle mouse

2026
01:06:38,319 --> 01:06:40,160
bring it over and this one i want the

2027
01:06:40,160 --> 01:06:41,920
stem to be a bit thinner and make it a

2028
01:06:41,920 --> 01:06:43,280
little bit smaller so i'll scale this

2029
01:06:43,280 --> 01:06:46,000
one down tab into edit mode just box

2030
01:06:46,000 --> 01:06:48,079
select the stem here and then hold down

2031
01:06:48,079 --> 01:06:50,240
alt and shift and select this loop and

2032
01:06:50,240 --> 01:06:51,920
i'll scale that down and just make that

2033
01:06:51,920 --> 01:06:54,480
really thin and then i can just select

2034
01:06:54,480 --> 01:06:56,640
the stem bring it down just make it a

2035
01:06:56,640 --> 01:06:59,119
lot longer and then scale this way down

2036
01:06:59,119 --> 01:07:01,280
and bring it up a bit and there we go

2037
01:07:01,280 --> 01:07:03,520
now we have a small thin mushroom all

2038
01:07:03,520 --> 01:07:05,119
right just one more type of mushroom now

2039
01:07:05,119 --> 01:07:07,359
i'm gonna make the red mushroom so i'm

2040
01:07:07,359 --> 01:07:09,599
going to press shift a and once again

2041
01:07:09,599 --> 01:07:12,000
add another circle make sure it has

2042
01:07:12,000 --> 01:07:14,799
eight vertices and then scale it down so

2043
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:16,000
we're basically going to be modeling

2044
01:07:16,000 --> 01:07:17,760
this the same way but a little bit

2045
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:20,079
different so i'll tab in edit mode here

2046
01:07:20,079 --> 01:07:22,160
fill that face we'll go one for front

2047
01:07:22,160 --> 01:07:24,880
view go into wireframe and this one i

2048
01:07:24,880 --> 01:07:26,880
want to be a bit fatter the stem a bit

2049
01:07:26,880 --> 01:07:29,200
fatter so i'll extrude this up scale it

2050
01:07:29,200 --> 01:07:31,440
down and i want the stem to again get

2051
01:07:31,440 --> 01:07:33,520
smaller as it goes in and then i'm going

2052
01:07:33,520 --> 01:07:36,079
to press e to extrude scale that up and

2053
01:07:36,079 --> 01:07:38,079
then bring it down a little bit e to

2054
01:07:38,079 --> 01:07:40,240
extrude again scale this up and this

2055
01:07:40,240 --> 01:07:41,760
mushroom instead of it being a shape

2056
01:07:41,760 --> 01:07:43,520
like this i want to be a little bit more

2057
01:07:43,520 --> 01:07:45,520
pointy and a little bit more out on the

2058
01:07:45,520 --> 01:07:48,000
sides so i'll extrude that up

2059
01:07:48,000 --> 01:07:50,559
and then extrude this scale it down

2060
01:07:50,559 --> 01:07:52,799
extrude it make it a bit more pointy and

2061
01:07:52,799 --> 01:07:54,799
a bit higher up and then extrude that

2062
01:07:54,799 --> 01:07:57,039
scale it down and then the face is

2063
01:07:57,039 --> 01:07:58,720
already filled okay i'm going to add a

2064
01:07:58,720 --> 01:08:00,720
loop cut right in here so ctrl r add a

2065
01:08:00,720 --> 01:08:02,559
loop cut and then i'm just going to box

2066
01:08:02,559 --> 01:08:04,240
select these vertices right here and

2067
01:08:04,240 --> 01:08:06,319
scale them up a little bit box select

2068
01:08:06,319 --> 01:08:08,079
these and scale them down a little bit

2069
01:08:08,079 --> 01:08:09,599
and i want the tip to be a bit more

2070
01:08:09,599 --> 01:08:12,160
pointy so i'll just box like this scale

2071
01:08:12,160 --> 01:08:13,839
it down and up a little bit more and

2072
01:08:13,839 --> 01:08:15,200
then right down here at the bottom of

2073
01:08:15,200 --> 01:08:16,719
the stem i want it to come out a little

2074
01:08:16,719 --> 01:08:18,719
bit and then quickly go back in so i'll

2075
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:20,719
tab into edit mode add a loop right here

2076
01:08:20,719 --> 01:08:23,040
by pressing ctrl r and then click and

2077
01:08:23,040 --> 01:08:24,960
then we'll scale it up and then go into

2078
01:08:24,960 --> 01:08:27,040
wireframe box select this area and scale

2079
01:08:27,040 --> 01:08:29,198
it down and then this here we need a box

2080
01:08:29,198 --> 01:08:30,880
like this and scale it up a little bit

2081
01:08:30,880 --> 01:08:32,158
and that way it kind of comes out and

2082
01:08:32,158 --> 01:08:34,158
then goes back in right at the end there

2083
01:08:34,158 --> 01:08:36,000
let's add the material now so i'm going

2084
01:08:36,000 --> 01:08:38,479
to click on this start typing in stem

2085
01:08:38,479 --> 01:08:39,759
because we want the stem to be the same

2086
01:08:39,759 --> 01:08:41,920
material then i'll tab into edit mode

2087
01:08:41,920 --> 01:08:44,640
just box select the top area right here

2088
01:08:44,640 --> 01:08:47,040
and i'll click the plus icon click on

2089
01:08:47,040 --> 01:08:50,319
new call this red mushroom

2090
01:08:50,319 --> 01:08:51,920
and then right here i'll make it pretty

2091
01:08:51,920 --> 01:08:53,759
red but a little bit orange not super

2092
01:08:53,759 --> 01:08:56,719
saturated but pretty saturated and then

2093
01:08:56,719 --> 01:08:58,719
just click on a sign and you can see now

2094
01:08:58,719 --> 01:09:00,719
we have a red mushroom now to make those

2095
01:09:00,719 --> 01:09:02,560
little white circles on the mushroom i'm

2096
01:09:02,560 --> 01:09:04,319
going to go over to the shading tab

2097
01:09:04,319 --> 01:09:05,759
we're going to be using a procedural

2098
01:09:05,759 --> 01:09:08,000
texture to make those little white dots

2099
01:09:08,000 --> 01:09:10,158
on the mushroom so i'll press shift a

2100
01:09:10,158 --> 01:09:12,640
i'm going to search for the veroni if i

2101
01:09:12,640 --> 01:09:14,960
can spell it right veroni texture and

2102
01:09:14,960 --> 01:09:16,399
then i'm going to use a feature from the

2103
01:09:16,399 --> 01:09:17,759
node wrangler add-on if you don't have

2104
01:09:17,759 --> 01:09:19,198
that enabled you can go edit and

2105
01:09:19,198 --> 01:09:20,399
preferences

2106
01:09:20,399 --> 01:09:22,319
and then right here on the add-ons start

2107
01:09:22,319 --> 01:09:23,759
typing in node and you can see there's

2108
01:09:23,759 --> 01:09:25,520
the node wrangler just check mark that

2109
01:09:25,520 --> 01:09:27,279
and then with the add-on enabled now i

2110
01:09:27,279 --> 01:09:29,679
can press ctrl t with the veroni texture

2111
01:09:29,679 --> 01:09:31,359
selected and that's going to add this

2112
01:09:31,359 --> 01:09:33,600
texture coordinate and mapping now the

2113
01:09:33,600 --> 01:09:34,960
object i just want to plug that up to

2114
01:09:34,960 --> 01:09:36,799
the vector and that way this froni

2115
01:09:36,799 --> 01:09:38,719
texture will be placed on the mushroom a

2116
01:09:38,719 --> 01:09:40,560
little bit better so i can now plug this

2117
01:09:40,560 --> 01:09:42,960
distance into the base color and you can

2118
01:09:42,960 --> 01:09:44,560
see what it's doing now right now the

2119
01:09:44,560 --> 01:09:46,000
dots are way too small so i'm going to

2120
01:09:46,000 --> 01:09:48,640
bring the scale down and then the dots

2121
01:09:48,640 --> 01:09:50,479
are faded way too much so i'll press

2122
01:09:50,479 --> 01:09:52,960
shift a search for a color ramp drop the

2123
01:09:52,960 --> 01:09:54,880
color ramp right in there and then this

2124
01:09:54,880 --> 01:09:56,560
black value and this white value if i

2125
01:09:56,560 --> 01:09:59,280
start to push these together you can see

2126
01:09:59,280 --> 01:10:00,640
that there's going to be a lot more

2127
01:10:00,640 --> 01:10:03,199
contrast and then the white i'm going to

2128
01:10:03,199 --> 01:10:05,280
make that red color so just change it

2129
01:10:05,280 --> 01:10:07,520
back to that red color right there and

2130
01:10:07,520 --> 01:10:09,360
then this black color i'm going to make

2131
01:10:09,360 --> 01:10:11,840
the white so just bring that up and

2132
01:10:11,840 --> 01:10:13,760
there we go now i think i want the scale

2133
01:10:13,760 --> 01:10:14,880
to be

2134
01:10:14,880 --> 01:10:16,640
a bit bigger just like that and then if

2135
01:10:16,640 --> 01:10:18,800
you want there to be less dots you can

2136
01:10:18,800 --> 01:10:20,400
bring these both back and you can see

2137
01:10:20,400 --> 01:10:22,480
there's a lot less dots now sometimes

2138
01:10:22,480 --> 01:10:23,600
instead of having circles these

2139
01:10:23,600 --> 01:10:25,760
mushrooms have some sort of square type

2140
01:10:25,760 --> 01:10:27,760
shapes and if you want to look like that

2141
01:10:27,760 --> 01:10:29,840
you can change this bottom value here to

2142
01:10:29,840 --> 01:10:32,400
manhattan and now you can see it has

2143
01:10:32,400 --> 01:10:34,480
these little kind of square rectangle

2144
01:10:34,480 --> 01:10:36,320
type things and if you like that better

2145
01:10:36,320 --> 01:10:38,000
then you can leave that setting on i'm

2146
01:10:38,000 --> 01:10:39,440
just going to change it back to the top

2147
01:10:39,440 --> 01:10:41,760
one here and then for some reason the

2148
01:10:41,760 --> 01:10:43,760
dots aren't really where you want

2149
01:10:43,760 --> 01:10:46,239
right over here on the location z you

2150
01:10:46,239 --> 01:10:47,760
can turn this and that's going to just

2151
01:10:47,760 --> 01:10:50,080
change the dots and you can just change

2152
01:10:50,080 --> 01:10:51,840
it to something that looks nice to you

2153
01:10:51,840 --> 01:10:53,440
alright we're almost done here i'm just

2154
01:10:53,440 --> 01:10:55,360
going to duplicate these and again just

2155
01:10:55,360 --> 01:10:56,880
like the other mushrooms tab into edit

2156
01:10:56,880 --> 01:10:58,640
mode and just box select the top of the

2157
01:10:58,640 --> 01:11:01,360
mushrooms and give it a random rotation

2158
01:11:01,360 --> 01:11:02,640
i'll just maybe make this one a little

2159
01:11:02,640 --> 01:11:04,320
bit smaller as well and then i'll make

2160
01:11:04,320 --> 01:11:06,560
one more mushroom by pressing shift d

2161
01:11:06,560 --> 01:11:08,080
let me go back into the layout so i have

2162
01:11:08,080 --> 01:11:09,840
a bit more space and then this one i

2163
01:11:09,840 --> 01:11:11,679
think i want to be a bit fatter so i'll

2164
01:11:11,679 --> 01:11:13,440
tab into edit mode select the whole

2165
01:11:13,440 --> 01:11:15,280
thing and press s and z

2166
01:11:15,280 --> 01:11:16,800
and bring that mushroom down and then

2167
01:11:16,800 --> 01:11:18,640
scale it out so it's a bit more of a

2168
01:11:18,640 --> 01:11:20,719
fatter mushroom and then this last one

2169
01:11:20,719 --> 01:11:23,120
here i will beat a box like this and

2170
01:11:23,120 --> 01:11:25,440
just give it a random rotation and there

2171
01:11:25,440 --> 01:11:27,840
we go look at that our nature assets are

2172
01:11:27,840 --> 01:11:29,600
finally done now just a couple things

2173
01:11:29,600 --> 01:11:31,120
that i want to do before we end one

2174
01:11:31,120 --> 01:11:33,199
thing that i want to do is press shift a

2175
01:11:33,199 --> 01:11:35,600
and i'm going to add a sunlight i'm just

2176
01:11:35,600 --> 01:11:37,199
going to bring this sunlight up rotate

2177
01:11:37,199 --> 01:11:39,440
it over a bit and then i can make the

2178
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:41,199
strength a little bit brighter and then

2179
01:11:41,199 --> 01:11:42,480
the color here i'm just going to make it

2180
01:11:42,480 --> 01:11:44,080
slightly yellow so that it looks like

2181
01:11:44,080 --> 01:11:45,760
sunlight and then one last thing that

2182
01:11:45,760 --> 01:11:47,440
i'm going to do because i'm using ev i

2183
01:11:47,440 --> 01:11:48,640
want to make it look a little bit more

2184
01:11:48,640 --> 01:11:50,400
realistic so i want to bake some of the

2185
01:11:50,400 --> 01:11:52,159
lighting and that way it will look more

2186
01:11:52,159 --> 01:11:53,840
realistic so i'm going to press shift a

2187
01:11:53,840 --> 01:11:55,440
and i'm going to go down here to light

2188
01:11:55,440 --> 01:11:56,640
probe and i'm going to click on the

2189
01:11:56,640 --> 01:11:59,040
irradiance volume and what i can do is i

2190
01:11:59,040 --> 01:12:00,960
can use this to bake the lighting and

2191
01:12:00,960 --> 01:12:02,800
make it look a bit more realistic so i'm

2192
01:12:02,800 --> 01:12:04,640
just going to scale this and just make

2193
01:12:04,640 --> 01:12:07,120
it so these little dots here are where

2194
01:12:07,120 --> 01:12:09,120
the nature assets are just about like

2195
01:12:09,120 --> 01:12:10,960
this maybe scale it down a little bit

2196
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:12,719
and then what i'm going to do is click

2197
01:12:12,719 --> 01:12:13,840
over here

2198
01:12:13,840 --> 01:12:16,159
to this rendering tab go down here and

2199
01:12:16,159 --> 01:12:18,080
there's this indirect lighting if i turn

2200
01:12:18,080 --> 01:12:20,400
this on and then click on bake indirect

2201
01:12:20,400 --> 01:12:22,400
lighting you can see that it just makes

2202
01:12:22,400 --> 01:12:24,480
the lighting look a bit more realistic

2203
01:12:24,480 --> 01:12:26,320
i'll save this project again and then if

2204
01:12:26,320 --> 01:12:28,480
i click on this it'll hide everything

2205
01:12:28,480 --> 01:12:30,560
else from the view and i'll press ctrl

2206
01:12:30,560 --> 01:12:33,840
spacebar to look at the finished assets

2207
01:12:33,840 --> 01:12:36,320
so there we go there is the low poly

2208
01:12:36,320 --> 01:12:38,320
nature asset tutorial if you make

2209
01:12:38,320 --> 01:12:39,840
something cool with these nature assets

2210
01:12:39,840 --> 01:12:41,280
you can definitely leave me a link in

2211
01:12:41,280 --> 01:12:42,960
the video description to your artwork

2212
01:12:42,960 --> 01:12:44,560
i'd love to see what you guys create

2213
01:12:44,560 --> 01:12:46,800
with your nature assets but with that

2214
01:12:46,800 --> 01:12:48,239
said thank you so much for watching and

2215
01:12:48,239 --> 01:12:51,840
