5
00:00:07,130 --> 00:00:08,039
okay

7
00:00:28,060 --> 00:00:30,500
hello guys and welcome to another video

8
00:00:30,500 --> 00:00:31,790
it's really windy and cold today

9
00:00:31,790 --> 00:00:33,740
hopefully it's warmer where you are if

10
00:00:33,740 --> 00:00:34,880
you haven't checked out my video where I

11
00:00:34,880 --> 00:00:37,370
make ten low poly cars in ten minutes

12
00:00:37,370 --> 00:00:38,989
go and check that on up first because

13
00:00:38,989 --> 00:00:40,280
today I'm gonna start putting those

14
00:00:40,280 --> 00:00:42,560
little racing cars or just normal cars

15
00:00:42,560 --> 00:00:44,510
as well I'll put them into a little

16
00:00:44,510 --> 00:00:46,489
racing game this won't be tutorial

17
00:00:46,489 --> 00:00:48,200
detailed all the way through but some

18
00:00:48,200 --> 00:00:49,820
things I'll put a little bit more in

19
00:00:49,820 --> 00:00:51,260
detail and some things I'll just have to

20
00:00:51,260 --> 00:00:53,450
fast forward and explain roughly what

21
00:00:53,450 --> 00:00:55,220
I'm doing so tag along I hope you enjoy

22
00:00:55,220 --> 00:00:56,750
this series let's do this one together

23
00:00:56,750 --> 00:00:58,460
let's have some fun and make some low

24
00:00:58,460 --> 00:01:04,430
poly racing I'm using this scene that I

25
00:01:04,430 --> 00:01:06,590
used before when I created the cars but

26
00:01:06,590 --> 00:01:08,780
I'll just hide most of them and keep one

27
00:01:08,780 --> 00:01:10,610
in for reference and first I made a

28
00:01:10,610 --> 00:01:13,490
little straight road segment so I went

29
00:01:13,490 --> 00:01:15,979
to top you and then I just did shift a

30
00:01:15,979 --> 00:01:19,490
to add a new mesh and I created a just a

31
00:01:19,490 --> 00:01:21,979
simple quad or a paint plane the gold

32
00:01:21,979 --> 00:01:28,280
plain I switched into edge select mode

33
00:01:28,280 --> 00:01:30,290
and I extruded the size of the edge

34
00:01:30,290 --> 00:01:33,080
because I hold the control key as well

35
00:01:33,080 --> 00:01:34,700
because then you can stop the movement

36
00:01:34,700 --> 00:01:36,950
so it's equal on both sides and then I

37
00:01:36,950 --> 00:01:39,259
also hold to move it downwards so it

38
00:01:39,259 --> 00:01:40,729
snaps in place the reason why I do this

39
00:01:40,729 --> 00:01:42,319
is because if you have a road profile

40
00:01:42,319 --> 00:01:44,330
like this with a slanted edges and you

41
00:01:44,330 --> 00:01:45,649
can have the ground profile and

42
00:01:45,649 --> 00:01:48,020
basically just to sink that into the

43
00:01:48,020 --> 00:01:49,580
ground I'm trying to show here I'll just

44
00:01:49,580 --> 00:01:52,100
slide it up in unity so you can see and

45
00:01:52,100 --> 00:01:53,720
then I add a mesh Collider to both of

46
00:01:53,720 --> 00:01:56,630
them and the good thing about this is

47
00:01:56,630 --> 00:01:58,490
that you can keep asphalt physics on the

48
00:01:58,490 --> 00:02:01,190
road and grass physics on the terrain

49
00:02:01,190 --> 00:02:02,420
itself so you have different

50
00:02:02,420 --> 00:02:04,700
characteristics so if you have a wheel

51
00:02:04,700 --> 00:02:06,530
Collider like this it's gonna be really

52
00:02:06,530 --> 00:02:07,910
good because they really like these

53
00:02:07,910 --> 00:02:11,510
smooth transitions so here's a clip from

54
00:02:11,510 --> 00:02:13,099
the game as well where I just in slow

55
00:02:13,099 --> 00:02:14,959
motion roll the car and you can see that

56
00:02:14,959 --> 00:02:16,880
the wheel collided just nicely goes up

57
00:02:16,880 --> 00:02:19,970
over that slanted edge so that's why

58
00:02:19,970 --> 00:02:21,410
I've got it cutting down through the

59
00:02:21,410 --> 00:02:23,270
ground like this another benefit is that

60
00:02:23,270 --> 00:02:24,739
the profile allows that you can have

61
00:02:24,739 --> 00:02:26,599
uneven ground and you can still you

62
00:02:26,599 --> 00:02:28,090
don't see the underneath of the road

63
00:02:28,090 --> 00:02:30,470
then I'm gonna add some road markings so

64
00:02:30,470 --> 00:02:33,290
I use just simple geometry for this you

65
00:02:33,290 --> 00:02:34,970
could use a texture map but I like the

66
00:02:34,970 --> 00:02:36,770
geometry method as you've seen in some

67
00:02:36,770 --> 00:02:38,510
of my videos because you can basically

68
00:02:38,510 --> 00:02:39,500
infinitely

69
00:02:39,500 --> 00:02:45,050
zooom without losing any quality what

70
00:02:45,050 --> 00:02:46,730
why else is it good oh yeah yeah it

71
00:02:46,730 --> 00:02:48,800
doesn't take up any texture space hardly

72
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:51,260
any at all so that's really good so I

73
00:02:51,260 --> 00:02:54,290
just do an inset here and I did a loop

74
00:02:54,290 --> 00:02:56,480
cut first because then I can delete the

75
00:02:56,480 --> 00:02:59,120
top and the bottom so I have the road

76
00:02:59,120 --> 00:03:00,920
markings nicely ending like this and

77
00:03:00,920 --> 00:03:03,140
then I just slide them up as well to

78
00:03:03,140 --> 00:03:05,780
make a bit of a bigger segment it didn't

79
00:03:05,780 --> 00:03:07,850
really have to be that precise but it

80
00:03:07,850 --> 00:03:10,790
was quite useful to just have a I like

81
00:03:10,790 --> 00:03:13,430
to precise I'm a bit picky so I like

82
00:03:13,430 --> 00:03:15,850
things to be precise believe it or not

83
00:03:15,850 --> 00:03:18,080
press end to get the properties panels

84
00:03:18,080 --> 00:03:19,400
up and you can actually type in the

85
00:03:19,400 --> 00:03:21,050
coordinates for the vertex is there so

86
00:03:21,050 --> 00:03:22,790
that's why I move them up and down so

87
00:03:22,790 --> 00:03:24,890
I've got a really nice square Road

88
00:03:24,890 --> 00:03:26,510
segment here or more or less than square

89
00:03:26,510 --> 00:03:28,730
anyway I've got a video check out the

90
00:03:28,730 --> 00:03:30,500
description below and you can see how I

91
00:03:30,500 --> 00:03:33,020
do this colorization so that should help

92
00:03:33,020 --> 00:03:35,150
you along the way if you need to next

93
00:03:35,150 --> 00:03:36,290
thing I wanted to do was to make a

94
00:03:36,290 --> 00:03:38,630
corner so I extend the existing Road

95
00:03:38,630 --> 00:03:41,300
segments to do that and then if you do

96
00:03:41,300 --> 00:03:43,280
shift and right mouse you can place the

97
00:03:43,280 --> 00:03:45,830
3d cursor and then do shift s to bring

98
00:03:45,830 --> 00:03:48,019
the snap menu up and you can stop the

99
00:03:48,019 --> 00:03:50,450
cursor to the grid and then I use this

100
00:03:50,450 --> 00:03:54,200
spin tool to extrude and spin the road

101
00:03:54,200 --> 00:03:59,239
as you can see here you can just you

102
00:03:59,239 --> 00:04:00,890
know it crushed

103
00:04:00,890 --> 00:04:04,480
protip save files before it's too late

104
00:04:04,480 --> 00:04:06,709
the reason why I crashed is because

105
00:04:06,709 --> 00:04:08,180
apparently you can't run screencast keys

106
00:04:08,180 --> 00:04:10,760
with this tool so I'll after we do it so

107
00:04:10,760 --> 00:04:13,340
I held the ctrl key to get the angles so

108
00:04:13,340 --> 00:04:15,590
I can slide it up to exactly 90 degrees

109
00:04:15,590 --> 00:04:17,180
and you can see that it extrudes and

110
00:04:17,180 --> 00:04:18,680
bends the road segment really nicely

111
00:04:18,680 --> 00:04:20,390
here so the corner is nearly done

112
00:04:20,390 --> 00:04:23,030
already then I have to do a little bit

113
00:04:23,030 --> 00:04:24,740
of tweaking as well because I want to

114
00:04:24,740 --> 00:04:27,979
add some curbs on the sides so on the

115
00:04:27,979 --> 00:04:29,450
inner and outer side I want to have some

116
00:04:29,450 --> 00:04:31,700
curbs and things like that but the road

117
00:04:31,700 --> 00:04:33,770
segment itself is pretty good at this

118
00:04:33,770 --> 00:04:36,010
stage

119
00:04:36,390 --> 00:04:39,070
so now it's time to add the curb as you

120
00:04:39,070 --> 00:04:40,360
can see here we've got a little police

121
00:04:40,360 --> 00:04:42,580
car skidding across the curb love that

122
00:04:42,580 --> 00:04:44,940
shop well slow mo for you there guys

123
00:04:44,940 --> 00:04:47,800
press 2 to get into edge select mode and

124
00:04:47,800 --> 00:04:51,340
then I basically Clifton Clift clicking

125
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,740
left mouse click to select the shortest

126
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:56,230
path to get all them and just selected

127
00:04:56,230 --> 00:04:58,060
and then I do shifty to duplicate them

128
00:04:58,060 --> 00:04:59,980
again now I do Shift + right mouse click

129
00:04:59,980 --> 00:05:02,860
to place the cursor and I snap it to the

130
00:05:02,860 --> 00:05:07,170
grid this I can get a really precise

131
00:05:07,170 --> 00:05:09,670
coordinate for the scaling because if I

132
00:05:09,670 --> 00:05:11,620
do the pivot point with a period key I

133
00:05:11,620 --> 00:05:14,170
can set that to be the 3d cursor and

134
00:05:14,170 --> 00:05:16,150
then I want to do extrude it really

135
00:05:16,150 --> 00:05:18,640
extrudes it nicely so I get a nice mesh

136
00:05:18,640 --> 00:05:23,890
for the curb to use and then I do a loop

137
00:05:23,890 --> 00:05:26,050
cut with ctrl R and I use the mouse

138
00:05:26,050 --> 00:05:27,850
wheel to just slide up the number of

139
00:05:27,850 --> 00:05:29,950
cuts so I think three should be

140
00:05:29,950 --> 00:05:32,740
sufficient for this one and then I want

141
00:05:32,740 --> 00:05:34,000
to raise them up but I want to do

142
00:05:34,000 --> 00:05:36,790
proportionally so in order to do that

143
00:05:36,790 --> 00:05:38,770
you can enable proportional editing it's

144
00:05:38,770 --> 00:05:41,410
Oh on the hotkey or you can click up

145
00:05:41,410 --> 00:05:44,140
there at the top as you can see use the

146
00:05:44,140 --> 00:05:46,180
mouse wheel to change how much it should

147
00:05:46,180 --> 00:05:48,580
affect and I just put press key and move

148
00:05:48,580 --> 00:05:50,800
it up so you can you can type and I

149
00:05:50,800 --> 00:05:52,420
think I end up typing in the number here

150
00:05:52,420 --> 00:05:54,670
to go together exactly 0.2 I think I

151
00:05:54,670 --> 00:05:57,340
checked and now you have a nice Bend to

152
00:05:57,340 --> 00:06:00,100
this curb segment as well so because I

153
00:06:00,100 --> 00:06:03,130
want it to be a nice bumpy curb so you

154
00:06:03,130 --> 00:06:08,140
can skip across it make sure you have

155
00:06:08,140 --> 00:06:10,480
Auto merge vertices enabled as well

156
00:06:10,480 --> 00:06:11,830
because we're going to be merging some

157
00:06:11,830 --> 00:06:14,230
of the sides now of this mesh so I do be

158
00:06:14,230 --> 00:06:16,690
for box select and then I collect a few

159
00:06:16,690 --> 00:06:19,150
of these vertices and then I just move

160
00:06:19,150 --> 00:06:20,740
them into place and I do this a little

161
00:06:20,740 --> 00:06:22,990
bit even though I like to be picky I

162
00:06:22,990 --> 00:06:25,780
just do that a little bit off what do

163
00:06:25,780 --> 00:06:28,090
you say white chance no yeah and just do

164
00:06:28,090 --> 00:06:29,890
it shooting from the hip that's what I'm

165
00:06:29,890 --> 00:06:31,920
doing

166
00:06:31,920 --> 00:06:34,440
so I'll just move it a little bit it's

167
00:06:34,440 --> 00:06:36,360
not that picky even though I like to be

168
00:06:36,360 --> 00:06:36,870
picky

169
00:06:36,870 --> 00:06:39,120
I like to talk about me as well I just

170
00:06:39,120 --> 00:06:41,430
select these vertices and move them in

171
00:06:41,430 --> 00:06:45,030
to get a little bit of a curb shape then

172
00:06:45,030 --> 00:06:47,010
I do the selection I hold the shift key

173
00:06:47,010 --> 00:06:48,450
to just to select the number of faces

174
00:06:48,450 --> 00:06:50,490
here because again I'm doing the

175
00:06:50,490 --> 00:06:54,210
colorization using just bringing the UV

176
00:06:54,210 --> 00:06:57,060
Islands to a pixel on a really tiny

177
00:06:57,060 --> 00:06:58,470
texture as you can see on the left but

178
00:06:58,470 --> 00:07:00,090
check out that video check out the link

179
00:07:00,090 --> 00:07:01,680
in the description that will help you

180
00:07:01,680 --> 00:07:04,410
along the way hmm

181
00:07:04,410 --> 00:07:07,020
every time I cough I get comments that I

182
00:07:07,020 --> 00:07:10,260
shouldn't so that's not grab the outer

183
00:07:10,260 --> 00:07:12,390
edge again and I want to extrude that

184
00:07:12,390 --> 00:07:14,040
one as well and I do the same method by

185
00:07:14,040 --> 00:07:16,890
setting the 3d cursor and extruding its

186
00:07:16,890 --> 00:07:18,690
you can't really do alt s to extrude

187
00:07:18,690 --> 00:07:20,040
along than normal because I just

188
00:07:20,040 --> 00:07:22,230
apparently don't have normals so you

189
00:07:22,230 --> 00:07:23,610
can't do that so I have to do this

190
00:07:23,610 --> 00:07:25,590
method instead and the reason why I

191
00:07:25,590 --> 00:07:27,090
extended like that is because I also

192
00:07:27,090 --> 00:07:28,590
want to bring that down so it slides

193
00:07:28,590 --> 00:07:31,200
down nicely under the terrain and you

194
00:07:31,200 --> 00:07:32,550
could extend it further if you want to

195
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:34,890
have even more possibility of a bumpy

196
00:07:34,890 --> 00:07:37,020
terrain fast-forward a little bit

197
00:07:37,020 --> 00:07:38,520
because I do pretty much the same thing

198
00:07:38,520 --> 00:07:40,560
here on the inner curb it's the same

199
00:07:40,560 --> 00:07:42,630
technique to some tweaking adjustment

200
00:07:42,630 --> 00:07:45,150
and then I select the UV islands and

201
00:07:45,150 --> 00:07:47,760
then I do the conversation as well nice

202
00:07:47,760 --> 00:07:48,930
thing is well you can just sweep up

203
00:07:48,930 --> 00:07:51,120
sweep out swap out the texture as well

204
00:07:51,120 --> 00:07:52,980
later on if you wanted to have blue and

205
00:07:52,980 --> 00:07:55,620
white curbs or something like that same

206
00:07:55,620 --> 00:07:57,360
thing here I extrude the inner edge so I

207
00:07:57,360 --> 00:07:59,310
can get the little slump down and then I

208
00:07:59,310 --> 00:08:01,260
clump those down I hold the control key

209
00:08:01,260 --> 00:08:04,470
to just move and add some vertices there

210
00:08:04,470 --> 00:08:06,120
so I can just clamp it down so it's got

211
00:08:06,120 --> 00:08:08,070
exactly the same profile as a road there

212
00:08:08,070 --> 00:08:10,560
so now it should connect nicely when I

213
00:08:10,560 --> 00:08:13,200
do multiple corners later on I should be

214
00:08:13,200 --> 00:08:14,880
able to link those up with a straight

215
00:08:14,880 --> 00:08:17,960
road and also a bunch of corners now

216
00:08:17,960 --> 00:08:21,500
we're going to do some jump love jumping

217
00:08:21,500 --> 00:08:24,759
[Applause]

218
00:08:36,500 --> 00:08:40,150
and you played supercars too

219
00:08:40,150 --> 00:08:54,419
[Music]

220
00:08:55,820 --> 00:08:57,529
so some slow-motion shots there for you

221
00:08:57,529 --> 00:09:01,070
and two I use the road segment the

222
00:09:01,070 --> 00:09:02,899
straight one that I did I do control R

223
00:09:02,899 --> 00:09:05,029
and I do about nine or ten loop cuts

224
00:09:05,029 --> 00:09:08,390
here and then basically I can just

225
00:09:08,390 --> 00:09:10,430
proportionally edit this now to get a

226
00:09:10,430 --> 00:09:13,700
little nicer slant so usually you want

227
00:09:13,700 --> 00:09:15,589
to duplicate your objects as well so you

228
00:09:15,589 --> 00:09:17,690
don't overwrite the road I over wrote my

229
00:09:17,690 --> 00:09:19,670
own segments a few times so I keep

230
00:09:19,670 --> 00:09:22,040
forgetting so make copies save and

231
00:09:22,040 --> 00:09:25,399
duplicate your objects now I enabled

232
00:09:25,399 --> 00:09:27,170
proportional editing again and then I

233
00:09:27,170 --> 00:09:29,300
just used the scroll wheel to scroll it

234
00:09:29,300 --> 00:09:32,540
up so I could get a nice there's no

235
00:09:32,540 --> 00:09:34,130
signs to this but later assigns to this

236
00:09:34,130 --> 00:09:36,830
but I didn't use it so I just shot from

237
00:09:36,830 --> 00:09:40,520
the hip again like a cowboy do they

238
00:09:40,520 --> 00:09:41,630
shoot from there I don't know if they

239
00:09:41,630 --> 00:09:44,690
did but anyway then I selected the

240
00:09:44,690 --> 00:09:47,300
bottom vertices and I pressed scale s to

241
00:09:47,300 --> 00:09:51,290
scale and then just Z is zero so I could

242
00:09:51,290 --> 00:09:53,120
just I got those in a nice straight line

243
00:09:53,120 --> 00:09:55,550
and then I just brought those down to

244
00:09:55,550 --> 00:09:58,279
the one one unit below so I knew that it

245
00:09:58,279 --> 00:09:59,630
will match up nicely with the road

246
00:09:59,630 --> 00:10:02,029
segment then I select the outer edges

247
00:10:02,029 --> 00:10:04,370
here in the in the empty space and then

248
00:10:04,370 --> 00:10:07,160
you just press F to create a face to cap

249
00:10:07,160 --> 00:10:09,230
that end nicely and that's pretty much

250
00:10:09,230 --> 00:10:12,560
it that is done now so the jump it's

251
00:10:12,560 --> 00:10:13,160
ready to go

252
00:10:13,160 --> 00:10:14,959
same for landing whoo now we're gonna

253
00:10:14,959 --> 00:10:16,760
create an overpass they're quite fun too

254
00:10:16,760 --> 00:10:18,230
and they're not as fun as jumps but

255
00:10:18,230 --> 00:10:21,140
they're quite fun so it will enable you

256
00:10:21,140 --> 00:10:22,940
to drive over the road and I think they

257
00:10:22,940 --> 00:10:26,390
had that in supercars two supercars too

258
00:10:26,390 --> 00:10:29,510
- yeah okay so same technique here I

259
00:10:29,510 --> 00:10:32,209
duplicated the road segments or at least

260
00:10:32,209 --> 00:10:33,800
that's what I should have done and then

261
00:10:33,800 --> 00:10:35,810
I do some more loop cuts this time

262
00:10:35,810 --> 00:10:37,010
because it's gotta be slightly longer

263
00:10:37,010 --> 00:10:38,930
I'm gonna do the same technique here I

264
00:10:38,930 --> 00:10:41,120
select a bunch of vertices and then I

265
00:10:41,120 --> 00:10:43,940
click o to do proportional editing first

266
00:10:43,940 --> 00:10:46,610
I forgot it but then I enabled it so I

267
00:10:46,610 --> 00:10:48,560
do the proportional editing and I just

268
00:10:48,560 --> 00:10:51,500
slide it off to a decent salams make

269
00:10:51,500 --> 00:10:53,450
sure you don't do so the very tip of the

270
00:10:53,450 --> 00:10:55,459
road it gets affected because that's or

271
00:10:55,459 --> 00:10:57,020
the end of the road because that needs

272
00:10:57,020 --> 00:10:59,360
to link up nicely to the road segment

273
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,400
that you have

274
00:11:01,400 --> 00:11:03,990
and then I had to do some tweaking as

275
00:11:03,990 --> 00:11:06,630
well you couldn't just have an empty

276
00:11:06,630 --> 00:11:09,090
like basically no faces underneath so I

277
00:11:09,090 --> 00:11:11,220
did some testing here for different

278
00:11:11,220 --> 00:11:12,780
techniques but I ended up going for

279
00:11:12,780 --> 00:11:15,000
something where I just pulled down I

280
00:11:15,000 --> 00:11:16,680
extrude it down the edges vertically

281
00:11:16,680 --> 00:11:19,500
down and then I selected the bottom

282
00:11:19,500 --> 00:11:21,540
edges and I pressed F along I selected

283
00:11:21,540 --> 00:11:23,790
all the edges and I just repeated that

284
00:11:23,790 --> 00:11:25,920
over and over again and created faces

285
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:28,230
underneath the road because here you're

286
00:11:28,230 --> 00:11:29,700
gonna be able to see some camera shots

287
00:11:29,700 --> 00:11:31,560
in probably not when you play the game

288
00:11:31,560 --> 00:11:33,090
but on replays and things like that

289
00:11:33,090 --> 00:11:34,500
you'll see the underneath so you can't

290
00:11:34,500 --> 00:11:37,140
have a no back faces there maybe there's

291
00:11:37,140 --> 00:11:40,020
a faster way to cut this I didn't use

292
00:11:40,020 --> 00:11:42,240
that a faster way I used this way this

293
00:11:42,240 --> 00:11:44,490
will way but I fast forward it a little

294
00:11:44,490 --> 00:11:45,810
bit in the video for you so that's

295
00:11:45,810 --> 00:11:48,360
pretty good in the end I just linked it

296
00:11:48,360 --> 00:11:49,710
up again and I have to make sure again

297
00:11:49,710 --> 00:11:51,720
that it should link nicely to the road

298
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,600
segment so I have to make sure that that

299
00:11:54,600 --> 00:11:58,440
I didn't affect the very very first set

300
00:11:58,440 --> 00:12:00,720
of vertices there you want to make sure

301
00:12:00,720 --> 00:12:03,270
that those linked oh so I use ctrl key I

302
00:12:03,270 --> 00:12:05,220
switch here to vertex snapping hold the

303
00:12:05,220 --> 00:12:07,140
ctrl key so I can snap those into the

304
00:12:07,140 --> 00:12:09,210
original vertex there you don't have to

305
00:12:09,210 --> 00:12:10,800
create the end faces because all the

306
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:13,170
roads will be linked up to each other so

307
00:12:13,170 --> 00:12:15,360
that can be left as a gap saves or

308
00:12:15,360 --> 00:12:17,580
massive performance not really look

309
00:12:17,580 --> 00:12:19,890
pretty good anyway alright

310
00:12:19,890 --> 00:12:21,750
some final tweaking there with the

311
00:12:21,750 --> 00:12:23,970
burgesses probably didn't have to do

312
00:12:23,970 --> 00:12:28,200
that but I did it anyway this road

313
00:12:28,200 --> 00:12:32,300
segment is pretty much ready to go now

314
00:12:32,630 --> 00:12:35,100
the car is just there for reference I

315
00:12:35,100 --> 00:12:37,220
could have hit up

316
00:12:37,220 --> 00:12:39,740
oh I have a some margin on the sides as

317
00:12:39,740 --> 00:12:40,940
well because I wanted to put some

318
00:12:40,940 --> 00:12:43,070
railing on it or some fences so that's

319
00:12:43,070 --> 00:12:44,510
why I extrude it a little bit to the

320
00:12:44,510 --> 00:12:46,100
side so I didn't just drop it down

321
00:12:46,100 --> 00:12:49,160
straight next to the road itself all

322
00:12:49,160 --> 00:12:51,080
right now it's time to do something

323
00:12:51,080 --> 00:12:52,070
completely different

324
00:12:52,070 --> 00:12:54,260
we're gonna do this straight finish line

325
00:12:54,260 --> 00:12:56,000
and that's the same technique as before

326
00:12:56,000 --> 00:12:57,920
to colorize but I do a whole bunch of

327
00:12:57,920 --> 00:12:59,900
loop cuts here both vertically and

328
00:12:59,900 --> 00:13:02,120
horizontally into a little checkered

329
00:13:02,120 --> 00:13:04,190
pattern again I'm gonna get loads of

330
00:13:04,190 --> 00:13:05,660
comments now saying that this is way too

331
00:13:05,660 --> 00:13:08,210
much geometry you're wasting performance

332
00:13:08,210 --> 00:13:09,830
you should just use a texture but I'm

333
00:13:09,830 --> 00:13:11,030
not gonna use the texture because that

334
00:13:11,030 --> 00:13:13,310
uses texture space and it doesn't zoom

335
00:13:13,310 --> 00:13:15,460
it's nicely assists us cuz I can zoom in

336
00:13:15,460 --> 00:13:18,410
infinitely there enough anyway and it'll

337
00:13:18,410 --> 00:13:21,800
look perfect no no messing around there

338
00:13:21,800 --> 00:13:24,200
with blurry textures even if you had a

339
00:13:24,200 --> 00:13:26,270
4k texture or something like that

340
00:13:26,270 --> 00:13:27,980
so I'm gonna use this method it's so few

341
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:29,660
polygons anyway that the performance is

342
00:13:29,660 --> 00:13:31,310
not gonna be a problem and if you're

343
00:13:31,310 --> 00:13:32,720
really concerned you could do a

344
00:13:32,720 --> 00:13:34,910
different one for the collider so it

345
00:13:34,910 --> 00:13:36,170
doesn't have that geometry you could

346
00:13:36,170 --> 00:13:39,490
just use the normal road segment

347
00:13:39,490 --> 00:13:42,290
[Music]

348
00:13:42,290 --> 00:13:45,709
I use all the different segments that

349
00:13:45,709 --> 00:13:46,910
I've created now and I linked them

350
00:13:46,910 --> 00:13:48,380
together I have got Auto merge of

351
00:13:48,380 --> 00:13:50,500
burgesses on which is really important I

352
00:13:50,500 --> 00:13:53,389
do this in the same mesh keep in mind

353
00:13:53,389 --> 00:13:55,759
keep keep in mind and keep in mind I

354
00:13:55,759 --> 00:13:58,100
don't create a bunch of separate message

355
00:13:58,100 --> 00:13:58,850
and meshes

356
00:13:58,850 --> 00:14:01,339
I don't create a bunch of separate

357
00:14:01,339 --> 00:14:04,459
message message I don't create a bunch

358
00:14:04,459 --> 00:14:07,730
of separate meshes because tried that in

359
00:14:07,730 --> 00:14:09,410
unity before and if you have separate

360
00:14:09,410 --> 00:14:12,319
meshes the colliders go a bit funky so

361
00:14:12,319 --> 00:14:14,420
basically if you jump over a jump and

362
00:14:14,420 --> 00:14:16,550
the car hits on the on the down slant

363
00:14:16,550 --> 00:14:18,769
for example and there's a joined Road

364
00:14:18,769 --> 00:14:21,170
segment there it could catch the

365
00:14:21,170 --> 00:14:24,920
collider and it doesn't work is good so

366
00:14:24,920 --> 00:14:26,240
that's why I've decided in this case

367
00:14:26,240 --> 00:14:29,660
anyway to do the entire road as one mesh

368
00:14:29,660 --> 00:14:32,540
in blender and export it there is a fix

369
00:14:32,540 --> 00:14:34,579
if you wanted to really have it modular

370
00:14:34,579 --> 00:14:36,350
and that is that you could keep separate

371
00:14:36,350 --> 00:14:38,509
modules assemble them in unity and then

372
00:14:38,509 --> 00:14:40,430
run a script that merges all the

373
00:14:40,430 --> 00:14:42,949
vertices for the Collider in unity it's

374
00:14:42,949 --> 00:14:46,850
a bit out of the class for this time but

375
00:14:46,850 --> 00:14:48,589
maybe I could do that in a future

376
00:14:48,589 --> 00:14:50,569
version if this game becomes to a point

377
00:14:50,569 --> 00:14:52,100
where I wanted to start to make it a

378
00:14:52,100 --> 00:14:53,449
little bit more modular and maybe a

379
00:14:53,449 --> 00:14:54,920
track editor or something like that I

380
00:14:54,920 --> 00:14:56,600
have to do that so maybe I'll come to

381
00:14:56,600 --> 00:15:00,319
that one day this is quite fun I just

382
00:15:00,319 --> 00:15:02,149
set the inverse and probably not that

383
00:15:02,149 --> 00:15:03,709
fun to watch but it was fun to make so

384
00:15:03,709 --> 00:15:07,250
just use your imagination and I I just

385
00:15:07,250 --> 00:15:10,130
basically select using box selected I

386
00:15:10,130 --> 00:15:12,829
select a bunch of faces and then I

387
00:15:12,829 --> 00:15:15,949
rotate them using the same method before

388
00:15:15,949 --> 00:15:17,810
with I have to make sure that I used the

389
00:15:17,810 --> 00:15:19,610
cursor it's snapping to grid so the

390
00:15:19,610 --> 00:15:22,040
rotation is aligned perfectly and then I

391
00:15:22,040 --> 00:15:23,660
just link a whole bunch of segments

392
00:15:23,660 --> 00:15:25,490
together and I create the track that

393
00:15:25,490 --> 00:15:28,899
you've seen in the intro screen there

394
00:15:29,540 --> 00:15:33,120
if you want to select the part of the

395
00:15:33,120 --> 00:15:34,590
mesh you could either box elect like I'm

396
00:15:34,590 --> 00:15:36,240
doing or sometimes you can press the L

397
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:38,040
key when you hover over a segment and

398
00:15:38,040 --> 00:15:40,530
I'll select that particular part so you

399
00:15:40,530 --> 00:15:42,990
could use both methods whichever you

400
00:15:42,990 --> 00:15:45,720
feel more comfortable with and then it's

401
00:15:45,720 --> 00:15:47,070
just a matter of I fast forward a little

402
00:15:47,070 --> 00:15:49,470
bit here because I just can't decide

403
00:15:49,470 --> 00:15:51,180
what I'm doing I'm tweaking a little bit

404
00:15:51,180 --> 00:15:53,910
probably too much changing my mind back

405
00:15:53,910 --> 00:15:56,910
and forth and forth and back but in the

406
00:15:56,910 --> 00:15:59,010
end it turns out to be a little nifty

407
00:15:59,010 --> 00:16:02,550
race track so I think if you've checked

408
00:16:02,550 --> 00:16:04,800
also my previous videos either the ten

409
00:16:04,800 --> 00:16:07,530
minutes fast builds or my tutorials my

410
00:16:07,530 --> 00:16:11,370
20 tips on blender tutorial most of

411
00:16:11,370 --> 00:16:13,320
these techniques I show in those videos

412
00:16:13,320 --> 00:16:15,480
pretty much in detail all the keyboard

413
00:16:15,480 --> 00:16:18,090
shortcuts and things like that so make

414
00:16:18,090 --> 00:16:19,560
sure you check out my channel history if

415
00:16:19,560 --> 00:16:21,180
you want to check some more check check

416
00:16:21,180 --> 00:16:21,390
check

417
00:16:21,390 --> 00:16:23,400
a lot of check in it but if you want to

418
00:16:23,400 --> 00:16:25,620
see some techniques anyway to learn a

419
00:16:25,620 --> 00:16:26,700
little bit more about this

420
00:16:26,700 --> 00:16:28,890
so obviously this part is not really a

421
00:16:28,890 --> 00:16:30,750
tutorial I could probably spend hours

422
00:16:30,750 --> 00:16:34,380
talking about this in all it took me

423
00:16:34,380 --> 00:16:37,410
about what could I say maybe half an

424
00:16:37,410 --> 00:16:39,330
hour to make the track something like

425
00:16:39,330 --> 00:16:41,970
that so because I kept changing my mind

426
00:16:41,970 --> 00:16:43,890
a little bit using different techniques

427
00:16:43,890 --> 00:16:46,050
and then I messed up the vertices a

428
00:16:46,050 --> 00:16:47,840
little bit and I had to redo a lot of

429
00:16:47,840 --> 00:16:51,830
merging process and things like that

430
00:17:01,410 --> 00:17:03,540
and that's it that's the track done so

431
00:17:03,540 --> 00:17:07,349
then I have to just do one thing more

432
00:17:07,349 --> 00:17:08,939
and that's just as simple terrain so I

433
00:17:08,939 --> 00:17:11,780
add another quad mesh here or a plane I

434
00:17:11,780 --> 00:17:14,309
make it about a hundred units in size

435
00:17:14,309 --> 00:17:17,280
and then I do a bunch of loop cuts again

436
00:17:17,280 --> 00:17:20,819
both horizontally and vertically and I

437
00:17:20,819 --> 00:17:22,650
like to keep the low-poly style and it's

438
00:17:22,650 --> 00:17:24,990
also nice for the for the car when it

439
00:17:24,990 --> 00:17:27,780
drives around to have some nice slanted

440
00:17:27,780 --> 00:17:29,340
edges I might increase the detail

441
00:17:29,340 --> 00:17:30,809
slightly in the future but for now I

442
00:17:30,809 --> 00:17:33,870
just kept it like this so I press ctrl R

443
00:17:33,870 --> 00:17:35,820
to do all the loop cuts in both

444
00:17:35,820 --> 00:17:38,190
directions here and then I just select a

445
00:17:38,190 --> 00:17:41,669
few random basically a few random faces

446
00:17:41,669 --> 00:17:43,200
and I raise them up a bit and I drop

447
00:17:43,200 --> 00:17:45,150
them down couldn't make up my mind again

448
00:17:45,150 --> 00:17:47,640
that's a bit of a trend that I've got to

449
00:17:47,640 --> 00:17:50,520
change my mind a lot but up and down

450
00:17:50,520 --> 00:17:53,340
down and up and then for some reason I

451
00:17:53,340 --> 00:17:55,500
selected all those individually totally

452
00:17:55,500 --> 00:17:58,200
idiotic but I did it anyway and made a

453
00:17:58,200 --> 00:17:59,460
little room there it's gonna be a police

454
00:17:59,460 --> 00:18:01,230
station there so I left a little gap

455
00:18:01,230 --> 00:18:03,510
there and here's a little canal or a

456
00:18:03,510 --> 00:18:05,100
little stream of water and there's a

457
00:18:05,100 --> 00:18:07,230
little lake part and then I created a

458
00:18:07,230 --> 00:18:08,850
little raised area as well so this is a

459
00:18:08,850 --> 00:18:11,429
lot of a bit of a diorama of a racetrack

460
00:18:11,429 --> 00:18:14,340
so maybe I'll add some stuff to the side

461
00:18:14,340 --> 00:18:17,490
so later on I'm not sure that's actually

462
00:18:17,490 --> 00:18:19,500
gonna be all that I show in this episode

463
00:18:19,500 --> 00:18:21,450
I've got everything the game is actually

464
00:18:21,450 --> 00:18:23,970
running now so I've set some fast lap

465
00:18:23,970 --> 00:18:26,190
times I had to make sure I kept playing

466
00:18:26,190 --> 00:18:29,309
until I had some 20 second life time it

467
00:18:29,309 --> 00:18:30,840
was a lot of fun took me a while maybe

468
00:18:30,840 --> 00:18:32,460
40 laps or something like that but it

469
00:18:32,460 --> 00:18:34,620
did in the end and I also use this it's

470
00:18:34,620 --> 00:18:37,710
super simple in unity to tangles with

471
00:18:37,710 --> 00:18:39,809
all the cables but you can either run it

472
00:18:39,809 --> 00:18:41,789
with a keyboard or you can use the

473
00:18:41,789 --> 00:18:43,409
controller and I think what I'll do is

474
00:18:43,409 --> 00:18:46,169
I'm gonna put together soon a little web

475
00:18:46,169 --> 00:18:47,970
playable version and I want to see how

476
00:18:47,970 --> 00:18:50,309
you guys can perform and what sort of a

477
00:18:50,309 --> 00:18:51,659
lot of times you get maybe I'll even

478
00:18:51,659 --> 00:18:54,059
throw a leaderboard in there before it

479
00:18:54,059 --> 00:18:55,559
maybe get a little healthy competition

480
00:18:55,559 --> 00:18:57,390
going while we make this game but should

481
00:18:57,390 --> 00:18:58,890
be fun I hope you liked this video and I

482
00:18:58,890 --> 00:19:00,150
hope it gave you a little bit of an

483
00:19:00,150 --> 00:19:02,909
insight to how I started making this

484
00:19:02,909 --> 00:19:04,620
little racing game I've got pretty much

485
00:19:04,620 --> 00:19:06,539
all the content recorded up until the

486
00:19:06,539 --> 00:19:08,640
game played in the plane I've got the

487
00:19:08,640 --> 00:19:09,990
wheel Collider the

488
00:19:09,990 --> 00:19:12,180
the life timer things with the

489
00:19:12,180 --> 00:19:13,680
checkpoints and things like that so

490
00:19:13,680 --> 00:19:15,480
everything that you've seen in the intro

491
00:19:15,480 --> 00:19:16,620
video and things like that I've already

492
00:19:16,620 --> 00:19:18,930
got that immunity running it's just a

493
00:19:18,930 --> 00:19:20,580
matter of me finding the time now to put

494
00:19:20,580 --> 00:19:22,260
those together into videos because

495
00:19:22,260 --> 00:19:24,270
everything's recorded so I hope you

496
00:19:24,270 --> 00:19:25,710
enjoyed this video it was a lot of fun

497
00:19:25,710 --> 00:19:27,060
to make it and I'm looking forward to

498
00:19:27,060 --> 00:19:28,860
putting the future episodes together and

499
00:19:28,860 --> 00:19:31,680
more importantly I like to play it and

500
00:19:31,680 --> 00:19:33,150
more importantly I want to play this

501
00:19:33,150 --> 00:19:35,430
game so I wonder if I can make it

502
00:19:35,430 --> 00:19:38,250
multiplayer as well I should be fun give

503
00:19:38,250 --> 00:19:39,750
