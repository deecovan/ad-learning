1
00:00:00,399 --> 00:00:02,240
i'm gonna switch the fan off now and uh

2
00:00:02,240 --> 00:00:04,640
get ready to record episode 34 of the 10

3
00:00:04,640 --> 00:00:05,839
minute modeling challenge

4
00:00:05,839 --> 00:00:07,839
hello guys and welcome back it's been

5
00:00:07,839 --> 00:00:09,519
four weeks of vacation for me but it's

6
00:00:09,519 --> 00:00:11,120
finally coming to a close now

7
00:00:11,120 --> 00:00:12,559
i thought i'd be able to ramp up my

8
00:00:12,559 --> 00:00:14,480
video stuff during my holiday but

9
00:00:14,480 --> 00:00:16,239
more or less i've been spending most of

10
00:00:16,239 --> 00:00:17,840
my time with the kids in the garden

11
00:00:17,840 --> 00:00:19,600
going down to the ocean having a bit of

12
00:00:19,600 --> 00:00:20,160
a swim

13
00:00:20,160 --> 00:00:21,359
you could call it the ocean it's the

14
00:00:21,359 --> 00:00:23,119
baltic sea really it's not been too much

15
00:00:23,119 --> 00:00:24,720
video work for me but i've had a great

16
00:00:24,720 --> 00:00:25,920
time and i hope you've had a great

17
00:00:25,920 --> 00:00:27,760
summer so far despite this whole covered

18
00:00:27,760 --> 00:00:29,199
thing let's just push that down the

19
00:00:29,199 --> 00:00:30,240
toilet and get back

20
00:00:30,240 --> 00:00:32,159
i hope that vaccine comes soon so we can

21
00:00:32,159 --> 00:00:33,360
start mingling a little bit

22
00:00:33,360 --> 00:00:36,559
more i'm dying to go to dying that's

23
00:00:36,559 --> 00:00:38,399
probably the wrong word to use now but

24
00:00:38,399 --> 00:00:40,480
i'm dying to go to the likes of gdc

25
00:00:40,480 --> 00:00:42,879
and unite is it called even unite yeah

26
00:00:42,879 --> 00:00:44,879
unite i remember going to unite berlin

27
00:00:44,879 --> 00:00:47,200
the unity convention there and i really

28
00:00:47,200 --> 00:00:48,879
missed that part of things and i just

29
00:00:48,879 --> 00:00:50,480
want to mingle with some people

30
00:00:50,480 --> 00:00:52,079
and that's coming from me who's normally

31
00:00:52,079 --> 00:00:53,840
just perfectly fine on my own

32
00:00:53,840 --> 00:00:55,440
the holiday is coming to a close so i'm

33
00:00:55,440 --> 00:00:57,360
going to go back to work on the rts game

34
00:00:57,360 --> 00:00:58,559
it's going to be a lot of fun picking

35
00:00:58,559 --> 00:01:00,320
that up again then i'll be making more

36
00:01:00,320 --> 00:01:01,120
videos

37
00:01:01,120 --> 00:01:02,640
the 10 minute modeling challenge and i'm

38
00:01:02,640 --> 00:01:04,319
gonna do more tutorials of course

39
00:01:04,319 --> 00:01:07,119
and not to forget i'm closing in now i'm

40
00:01:07,119 --> 00:01:08,799
past 95k subscribers

41
00:01:08,799 --> 00:01:10,880
thanks a lot guys i'm really excited

42
00:01:10,880 --> 00:01:12,000
about that and to

43
00:01:12,000 --> 00:01:14,880
celebrate 100k i'm gonna do a 24 hour

44
00:01:14,880 --> 00:01:16,080
live stream

45
00:01:16,080 --> 00:01:18,320
that's terrifying because uh i i

46
00:01:18,320 --> 00:01:19,680
struggle with it being a three one i'd

47
00:01:19,680 --> 00:01:21,200
probably get an achy shoulder and all

48
00:01:21,200 --> 00:01:22,640
sorts of things but i'm gonna do it i'm

49
00:01:22,640 --> 00:01:24,960
gonna try 24 hours and i'm gonna model a

50
00:01:24,960 --> 00:01:26,720
whole bunch of characters

51
00:01:26,720 --> 00:01:28,720
so watch out for that one if you want to

52
00:01:28,720 --> 00:01:30,079
know when i'm going to stream it i'm

53
00:01:30,079 --> 00:01:31,680
going to announce it in good time

54
00:01:31,680 --> 00:01:33,040
and i'm going to announce it even now

55
00:01:33,040 --> 00:01:34,479
because it's going to be the first

56
00:01:34,479 --> 00:01:35,520
saturday

57
00:01:35,520 --> 00:01:38,560
after the day i hit 100k

58
00:01:38,560 --> 00:01:40,400
so if i hit it on a saturday i'll have

59
00:01:40,400 --> 00:01:41,759
to wait to the next saturday because i

60
00:01:41,759 --> 00:01:43,680
want to give it enough notice anyway

61
00:01:43,680 --> 00:01:45,360
so keep that in mind guys when i hit

62
00:01:45,360 --> 00:01:47,200
100k subscribers

63
00:01:47,200 --> 00:01:49,280
check when the next saturdays schedule

64
00:01:49,280 --> 00:01:50,880
that in and you're going to have to sit

65
00:01:50,880 --> 00:01:52,399
nailed to your screen and watch me

66
00:01:52,399 --> 00:01:54,560
through the entire session

67
00:01:54,560 --> 00:01:56,399
probably not not gonna happen i'm gonna

68
00:01:56,399 --> 00:01:58,000
struggle myself even got rid of the

69
00:01:58,000 --> 00:01:59,280
green screen for now because

70
00:01:59,280 --> 00:02:00,640
it looked a little bit fake when i was

71
00:02:00,640 --> 00:02:02,399
doing the intros but i'm gonna put it up

72
00:02:02,399 --> 00:02:04,960
for the video so i can filter myself out

73
00:02:04,960 --> 00:02:06,880
feels like i'm on uh on a lot of coffee

74
00:02:06,880 --> 00:02:08,000
in today caffeine

75
00:02:08,000 --> 00:02:09,119
i'm ramping up on the caffeine as you

76
00:02:09,119 --> 00:02:11,120
can hear and i've got my extrusion came

77
00:02:11,120 --> 00:02:12,160
through today after three weeks of

78
00:02:12,160 --> 00:02:13,200
delivery so if you're if you live in

79
00:02:13,200 --> 00:02:13,920
europe and you order

80
00:02:13,920 --> 00:02:15,040
uh my merch be right back you could take

81
00:02:15,040 --> 00:02:16,800
it because something i can't have from

82
00:02:16,800 --> 00:02:19,120
the us

83
00:02:19,120 --> 00:02:20,480
today guys i'm gonna be modeling

84
00:02:20,480 --> 00:02:22,400
something that has been requested a lot

85
00:02:22,400 --> 00:02:23,760
through the past half a year that i've

86
00:02:23,760 --> 00:02:25,360
been making this challenge and it's

87
00:02:25,360 --> 00:02:26,319
gonna be a tank

88
00:02:26,319 --> 00:02:28,080
i'm gonna make a sci-fi tank i hope

89
00:02:28,080 --> 00:02:29,440
that's okay but it gives a little bit

90
00:02:29,440 --> 00:02:31,120
more creative freedom i think than

91
00:02:31,120 --> 00:02:32,239
modeling a real one

92
00:02:32,239 --> 00:02:34,000
if you also want me to model a real tank

93
00:02:34,000 --> 00:02:35,360
give me a shout in the comments

94
00:02:35,360 --> 00:02:37,599
maybe i can do a tiger or an abrams tank

95
00:02:37,599 --> 00:02:38,480
or something like that

96
00:02:38,480 --> 00:02:40,800
so a tank has been requested by drizox

97
00:02:40,800 --> 00:02:42,560
nexus jacob marborg

98
00:02:42,560 --> 00:02:45,599
alfred merton zenob xbb remore

99
00:02:45,599 --> 00:02:48,800
dimitri cabanov does dirk basil aldo and

100
00:02:48,800 --> 00:02:49,599
deerfur

101
00:02:49,599 --> 00:02:51,840
niddler like knitter maybe probably not

102
00:02:51,840 --> 00:02:53,599
that i think it's something else

103
00:02:53,599 --> 00:02:55,440
anyway i also had a request not to model

104
00:02:55,440 --> 00:02:57,280
a tank from shibby bill he said

105
00:02:57,280 --> 00:02:58,640
there's enough tanks on the internet but

106
00:02:58,640 --> 00:03:00,400
i'm gonna model a tank anyway so sorry

107
00:03:00,400 --> 00:03:01,920
for that ship named little i also had a

108
00:03:01,920 --> 00:03:02,879
request from

109
00:03:02,879 --> 00:03:04,959
my female audience they want me to make

110
00:03:04,959 --> 00:03:06,879
not only a tank but tank tops

111
00:03:06,879 --> 00:03:08,640
so this is just going to have to be an

112
00:03:08,640 --> 00:03:10,159
interim i didn't have a chance to

113
00:03:10,159 --> 00:03:12,800
fix that much through my vacation time

114
00:03:12,800 --> 00:03:14,400
but i'm going to be making the e2

115
00:03:14,400 --> 00:03:16,000
extrude as the scale tank tops

116
00:03:16,000 --> 00:03:17,760
especially the e2 extrude that's the

117
00:03:17,760 --> 00:03:20,000
scale tank tops are coming but for now

118
00:03:20,000 --> 00:03:21,380
let's model a tank

119
00:03:21,380 --> 00:03:24,400
[Music]

120
00:03:24,400 --> 00:03:27,599
thank me later i sounded irish thank me

121
00:03:27,599 --> 00:03:28,560
later

122
00:03:28,560 --> 00:03:32,000
no it didn't ready steady

123
00:03:32,000 --> 00:03:34,720
go when we're off yes i can see it and

124
00:03:34,720 --> 00:03:36,000
auto mirror

125
00:03:36,000 --> 00:03:38,640
of course tab into edit mode scale scale

126
00:03:38,640 --> 00:03:39,040
it down

127
00:03:39,040 --> 00:03:41,360
go to side view move it up scale it down

128
00:03:41,360 --> 00:03:42,560
on the z axis

129
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:44,000
move it to there remember this is going

130
00:03:44,000 --> 00:03:46,159
to be a sci-fi tank now

131
00:03:46,159 --> 00:03:48,879
i'm going to do it like that scale y

132
00:03:48,879 --> 00:03:49,519
that's y

133
00:03:49,519 --> 00:03:53,280
e to extrude scale y and

134
00:03:53,280 --> 00:03:56,799
l let's go side view here make it longer

135
00:03:56,799 --> 00:03:59,120
fatter and wider usually not always that

136
00:03:59,120 --> 00:04:00,480
good but for a tank i think it's pretty

137
00:04:00,480 --> 00:04:01,519
good

138
00:04:01,519 --> 00:04:03,599
move it out a little bit more and uh

139
00:04:03,599 --> 00:04:04,799
let's do

140
00:04:04,799 --> 00:04:06,480
e2 extrude one more time and i'm going

141
00:04:06,480 --> 00:04:08,000
to extrude these up

142
00:04:08,000 --> 00:04:09,920
all t this time to do extrude long phase

143
00:04:09,920 --> 00:04:12,159
normals this is going to be like the mud

144
00:04:12,159 --> 00:04:12,959
guards

145
00:04:12,959 --> 00:04:14,799
why a sci-fi tank would need mud guards

146
00:04:14,799 --> 00:04:16,639
i have no idea shift select a few of

147
00:04:16,639 --> 00:04:18,720
those e to extrude that on

148
00:04:18,720 --> 00:04:21,120
select the little ends here now actually

149
00:04:21,120 --> 00:04:21,918
i need that little

150
00:04:21,918 --> 00:04:24,000
one as well alt e to extrude long face

151
00:04:24,000 --> 00:04:25,040
normals

152
00:04:25,040 --> 00:04:26,960
and here let's make the side tracks as

153
00:04:26,960 --> 00:04:28,479
well

154
00:04:28,479 --> 00:04:31,440
so shift d to duplicate those two faces

155
00:04:31,440 --> 00:04:32,639
scale them up a bit

156
00:04:32,639 --> 00:04:35,520
move them down and scale them on the y

157
00:04:35,520 --> 00:04:36,400
axis

158
00:04:36,400 --> 00:04:38,639
maybe like that and e to extrude that

159
00:04:38,639 --> 00:04:40,160
whole thing and that's going to be our

160
00:04:40,160 --> 00:04:41,280
tracks they're going to poke out a

161
00:04:41,280 --> 00:04:42,639
little bit wider

162
00:04:42,639 --> 00:04:46,560
the wider the cooler okay so

163
00:04:46,560 --> 00:04:48,160
let's shift select a few of these

164
00:04:48,160 --> 00:04:49,360
actually i could have selected it with

165
00:04:49,360 --> 00:04:50,479
control but never mind

166
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:52,160
move that down get some angle on that

167
00:04:52,160 --> 00:04:55,280
one and how am i doing 838 okay

168
00:04:55,280 --> 00:04:57,280
now i'm gonna raise it up uh this is a

169
00:04:57,280 --> 00:04:58,800
sci-fi tank but i'm gonna have a little

170
00:04:58,800 --> 00:05:01,080
bit of inspiration from like the

171
00:05:01,080 --> 00:05:03,680
m1a2 out of abrams

172
00:05:03,680 --> 00:05:06,240
i'm gonna raise this rear part up a

173
00:05:06,240 --> 00:05:06,720
little bit

174
00:05:06,720 --> 00:05:08,479
i think it looks a little bit cool

175
00:05:08,479 --> 00:05:10,320
control select to there

176
00:05:10,320 --> 00:05:12,560
move that back and that should be all

177
00:05:12,560 --> 00:05:13,360
right

178
00:05:13,360 --> 00:05:15,520
now let's do here's the tracks then

179
00:05:15,520 --> 00:05:17,039
let's just also do them a little bit

180
00:05:17,039 --> 00:05:17,840
tron like

181
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:21,039
tron or sci-fi i'm not sure but it's

182
00:05:21,039 --> 00:05:23,120
going to be low poly of course

183
00:05:23,120 --> 00:05:25,360
need to extrude the center let's select

184
00:05:25,360 --> 00:05:26,720
this whole thing and make it

185
00:05:26,720 --> 00:05:30,000
brown black so like this make it i like

186
00:05:30,000 --> 00:05:31,360
to instead of a normal gray i like to

187
00:05:31,360 --> 00:05:31,919
have this

188
00:05:31,919 --> 00:05:34,080
bluish tint to it i think it looks a bit

189
00:05:34,080 --> 00:05:35,759
more metal like

190
00:05:35,759 --> 00:05:38,080
okay and now let's make the turret so

191
00:05:38,080 --> 00:05:39,520
i'm gonna do

192
00:05:39,520 --> 00:05:41,039
actually i wanted these to be raised as

193
00:05:41,039 --> 00:05:43,360
well i don't want

194
00:05:43,360 --> 00:05:46,000
necessarily that to be no i don't that

195
00:05:46,000 --> 00:05:47,840
should be alright

196
00:05:47,840 --> 00:05:50,400
uh shift d duplicate that face scale it

197
00:05:50,400 --> 00:05:51,520
down move it in there

198
00:05:51,520 --> 00:05:54,479
e to extrude that one and let's actually

199
00:05:54,479 --> 00:05:55,280
scale it on the y

200
00:05:55,280 --> 00:05:58,319
axis shift d to duplicate it again

201
00:05:58,319 --> 00:06:02,960
scale it before i scale it let's

202
00:06:04,000 --> 00:06:05,759
let's see l to select it move it up a

203
00:06:05,759 --> 00:06:08,080
bit e to extrude

204
00:06:08,080 --> 00:06:11,120
slide it to there up need to extrude

205
00:06:11,120 --> 00:06:13,120
slide it to there so this is going to be

206
00:06:13,120 --> 00:06:15,600
the upper part of the turret

207
00:06:15,600 --> 00:06:17,280
i always thought it was turrent when i

208
00:06:17,280 --> 00:06:19,120
was a kid but apparently it's turret

209
00:06:19,120 --> 00:06:21,840
i learned about 20 years ago e to

210
00:06:21,840 --> 00:06:22,800
extrude that on

211
00:06:22,800 --> 00:06:26,400
scale need to extrude and scale it down

212
00:06:26,400 --> 00:06:28,080
maybe bring it in a little bit let's try

213
00:06:28,080 --> 00:06:30,160
to get some

214
00:06:30,160 --> 00:06:32,240
i think the lower and sleeker it looks

215
00:06:32,240 --> 00:06:35,680
uh the cooler looks so let's do that

216
00:06:35,680 --> 00:06:39,440
and ctrl r let's do 6 oh whoa not 60.

217
00:06:39,440 --> 00:06:43,280
ctrl r 6 loop cuts there

218
00:06:43,280 --> 00:06:46,560
and alt shift select these i to inset

219
00:06:46,560 --> 00:06:48,240
and b to get the boundary thing in the

220
00:06:48,240 --> 00:06:49,199
center remember

221
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:52,639
alt s to scale them down and

222
00:06:52,639 --> 00:06:54,479
control plus to expand the selection and

223
00:06:54,479 --> 00:06:56,080
make that black it looks a bit

224
00:06:56,080 --> 00:06:58,800
some feature of some sort now let's make

225
00:06:58,800 --> 00:06:59,440
the

226
00:06:59,440 --> 00:07:00,800
this one we can tilt a little bit more

227
00:07:00,800 --> 00:07:02,639
as well i think it's more modern to have

228
00:07:02,639 --> 00:07:03,120
it

229
00:07:03,120 --> 00:07:05,039
like slanted so the shells bounce off

230
00:07:05,039 --> 00:07:06,319
this one now we're going to make

231
00:07:06,319 --> 00:07:08,400
the cannon before i do that actually

232
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:10,960
i'll do i to insert this one

233
00:07:10,960 --> 00:07:14,080
move it in e to extrude it

234
00:07:14,080 --> 00:07:16,560
in like that now shift d to duplicate

235
00:07:16,560 --> 00:07:17,840
that scale

236
00:07:17,840 --> 00:07:21,199
y zero to flatten it

237
00:07:21,199 --> 00:07:24,240
and scale it down a bit

238
00:07:24,240 --> 00:07:25,919
and before i do anything else i'll do

239
00:07:25,919 --> 00:07:27,599
ctrl r to loop cut that one

240
00:07:27,599 --> 00:07:29,759
move it out i want to have some shape to

241
00:07:29,759 --> 00:07:30,880
this barrel

242
00:07:30,880 --> 00:07:32,639
a bit sci-fi as well i have no clue if

243
00:07:32,639 --> 00:07:34,560
that's sci-fi or not but we need sci-fi

244
00:07:34,560 --> 00:07:36,479
e to extrude

245
00:07:36,479 --> 00:07:39,199
e to extrude s to scale e to extrude e

246
00:07:39,199 --> 00:07:40,800
to extrude s to scale

247
00:07:40,800 --> 00:07:43,919
e to extrude does that look sci-fi i

248
00:07:43,919 --> 00:07:44,240
think

249
00:07:44,240 --> 00:07:47,039
i think it does when it's like uh flat

250
00:07:47,039 --> 00:07:49,199
or i need a wider like this

251
00:07:49,199 --> 00:07:52,879
and higher control r

252
00:07:52,879 --> 00:07:55,280
let's do uh like this alt e to extrude

253
00:07:55,280 --> 00:07:58,000
long face normals scale them down

254
00:07:58,000 --> 00:08:01,199
some feature of some sort and

255
00:08:01,199 --> 00:08:02,800
i'm also going to do like a rail gun

256
00:08:02,800 --> 00:08:04,720
type of thing so let's take this one

257
00:08:04,720 --> 00:08:07,120
and do he tooks through that one need to

258
00:08:07,120 --> 00:08:08,560
extrude it again

259
00:08:08,560 --> 00:08:10,800
move it in a bit and now i'm going to do

260
00:08:10,800 --> 00:08:12,000
this has got

261
00:08:12,000 --> 00:08:13,280
sorry guys if you were expecting a

262
00:08:13,280 --> 00:08:14,879
normal tank this is a sci-fi tank

263
00:08:14,879 --> 00:08:16,720
remember e to extrude

264
00:08:16,720 --> 00:08:19,759
s to scale move it in it's like a tie

265
00:08:19,759 --> 00:08:20,960
fighter look here

266
00:08:20,960 --> 00:08:24,080
scale zed but a railgun for some reason

267
00:08:24,080 --> 00:08:25,680
the ones i've seen anyway i've got these

268
00:08:25,680 --> 00:08:27,759
uh ramp things on the side or rail

269
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:29,440
things on the side so

270
00:08:29,440 --> 00:08:31,280
let's move this one out a bit as well

271
00:08:31,280 --> 00:08:32,640
control r let's do six

272
00:08:32,640 --> 00:08:35,120
loop cuts here as well alt select those

273
00:08:35,120 --> 00:08:36,000
with shift

274
00:08:36,000 --> 00:08:40,080
i to inset alt s to scale them down

275
00:08:40,080 --> 00:08:43,120
maybe like that and then g okay that was

276
00:08:43,120 --> 00:08:43,919
black as well

277
00:08:43,919 --> 00:08:46,240
and for this barrel thing we need to do

278
00:08:46,240 --> 00:08:47,440
uh item

279
00:08:47,440 --> 00:08:50,959
no select both of these actually

280
00:08:50,959 --> 00:08:54,640
item set each extrude

281
00:08:54,640 --> 00:08:57,839
i to in set one more time nope can't do

282
00:08:57,839 --> 00:08:58,720
that

283
00:08:58,720 --> 00:09:00,320
to move this down a bit to give it some

284
00:09:00,320 --> 00:09:02,640
space

285
00:09:03,279 --> 00:09:09,120
and then iten set e to extrude that on

286
00:09:09,120 --> 00:09:12,160
okay that's not nice let's extrude this

287
00:09:12,160 --> 00:09:13,760
whole thing in instead e texture that

288
00:09:13,760 --> 00:09:14,399
looks

289
00:09:14,399 --> 00:09:18,080
more mean i think control selector there

290
00:09:18,080 --> 00:09:21,120
i to inset but b to get the boundary off

291
00:09:21,120 --> 00:09:22,959
because i want to have these alt s

292
00:09:22,959 --> 00:09:24,480
raised up a little bit as well

293
00:09:24,480 --> 00:09:25,839
also gives it a bit of character and

294
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:27,760
maybe it will raise these up as well

295
00:09:27,760 --> 00:09:31,519
i think set and move those up as well

296
00:09:31,519 --> 00:09:34,839
like that actually i'll do e to extrude

297
00:09:34,839 --> 00:09:36,720
those and then maybe

298
00:09:36,720 --> 00:09:38,560
scale them down and then i'll take these

299
00:09:38,560 --> 00:09:39,760
edges

300
00:09:39,760 --> 00:09:42,399
here that one move them forward okay so

301
00:09:42,399 --> 00:09:44,720
that gives a bit of a feature so 349

302
00:09:44,720 --> 00:09:46,240
let's do some more features here then a

303
00:09:46,240 --> 00:09:47,680
lot of feature stuff here we can put

304
00:09:47,680 --> 00:09:49,200
some armor and plates on it maybe so i

305
00:09:49,200 --> 00:09:51,839
shift select a bunch of these

306
00:09:51,839 --> 00:09:54,560
maybe like that and maybe these two as

307
00:09:54,560 --> 00:09:55,279
well

308
00:09:55,279 --> 00:09:57,040
no i'll leave those i'll do those after

309
00:09:57,040 --> 00:09:59,600
i didn't set twice so i get the

310
00:09:59,600 --> 00:10:03,360
individual alt s to scale along normals

311
00:10:03,360 --> 00:10:05,680
like that ctrl plus and then let's

312
00:10:05,680 --> 00:10:07,519
darken those to there

313
00:10:07,519 --> 00:10:09,440
control minus and make the armor plates

314
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:10,880
a little bit darker

315
00:10:10,880 --> 00:10:12,720
here let's put some features here i to

316
00:10:12,720 --> 00:10:14,800
inset twice so we get the boundary thing

317
00:10:14,800 --> 00:10:15,680
off

318
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:18,160
alt e to extrude long face normals just

319
00:10:18,160 --> 00:10:20,240
do some weird features here i think

320
00:10:20,240 --> 00:10:24,399
itin set alt s to scale the one up

321
00:10:24,399 --> 00:10:27,920
so i have no clue what i'm doing

322
00:10:27,920 --> 00:10:29,760
hope that's okay with you guys need to

323
00:10:29,760 --> 00:10:31,200
extrude that one

324
00:10:31,200 --> 00:10:32,640
i'll just kind of slap some features on

325
00:10:32,640 --> 00:10:35,200
here literally literally but

326
00:10:35,200 --> 00:10:39,360
not slapping anything but yeah let's see

327
00:10:39,360 --> 00:10:41,600
okay so here let's do shift select those

328
00:10:41,600 --> 00:10:43,519
i've got 251 on the clock here

329
00:10:43,519 --> 00:10:45,360
let's make that one armored colored as

330
00:10:45,360 --> 00:10:47,839
well

331
00:10:48,880 --> 00:10:50,320
there i'm feeling a bit rusty because i

332
00:10:50,320 --> 00:10:52,000
missed last week

333
00:10:52,000 --> 00:10:53,440
well i had a video last week but i

334
00:10:53,440 --> 00:10:55,920
wasn't uh recording i recorded that one

335
00:10:55,920 --> 00:10:57,920
two weeks ago since i was doing uh

336
00:10:57,920 --> 00:10:59,360
the holiday thing so i feel a little bit

337
00:10:59,360 --> 00:11:01,680
rusty here oh that's okay

338
00:11:01,680 --> 00:11:05,040
scale that down no let's not skip it

339
00:11:05,040 --> 00:11:07,200
down

340
00:11:07,200 --> 00:11:08,959
okay let's do uh some more features i'll

341
00:11:08,959 --> 00:11:11,360
just put some more features on here

342
00:11:11,360 --> 00:11:14,880
all the to extrude long face normals

343
00:11:14,880 --> 00:11:17,920
like that g to move it to black

344
00:11:17,920 --> 00:11:21,200
here let's do more features

345
00:11:21,200 --> 00:11:24,399
you get the drill the jill

346
00:11:24,399 --> 00:11:26,959
you understand what i'm doing it's just

347
00:11:26,959 --> 00:11:28,800
some random stuff here now e to extrude

348
00:11:28,800 --> 00:11:30,079
as the scale

349
00:11:30,079 --> 00:11:33,120
uh here inside the barrel of the

350
00:11:33,120 --> 00:11:36,640
gun let's do that black as well

351
00:11:36,640 --> 00:11:40,160
156 what more should we do maybe we'll

352
00:11:40,160 --> 00:11:42,480
do uh

353
00:11:42,480 --> 00:11:44,160
this track thing is going to have to

354
00:11:44,160 --> 00:11:46,079
stay like that i think maybe here we'll

355
00:11:46,079 --> 00:11:49,360
do also i think set

356
00:11:49,600 --> 00:11:52,320
and move that out slightly more features

357
00:11:52,320 --> 00:11:54,480
just some more detail

358
00:11:54,480 --> 00:11:57,920
and here let's do

359
00:11:57,920 --> 00:11:59,680
what should we do here any ideas

360
00:11:59,680 --> 00:12:01,440
suggestions

361
00:12:01,440 --> 00:12:02,880
this is not live things i couldn't even

362
00:12:02,880 --> 00:12:04,720
take your suggestions if i want to do

363
00:12:04,720 --> 00:12:05,920
i think the only thing i really have

364
00:12:05,920 --> 00:12:07,920
time for is to do more extrusions and

365
00:12:07,920 --> 00:12:09,040
scaling here so

366
00:12:09,040 --> 00:12:10,800
that's all i'm going to do for now i

367
00:12:10,800 --> 00:12:15,040
think balti to extrude long face normals

368
00:12:15,040 --> 00:12:18,079
so this is all the detail armored plates

369
00:12:18,079 --> 00:12:19,040
are there

370
00:12:19,040 --> 00:12:20,800
should we do some coloring on the barrel

371
00:12:20,800 --> 00:12:22,079
here as well maybe

372
00:12:22,079 --> 00:12:25,360
make that dark maybe we'll

373
00:12:25,360 --> 00:12:27,120
change this whole barrel actually to a

374
00:12:27,120 --> 00:12:28,880
darker shade

375
00:12:28,880 --> 00:12:32,000
there and here this color in there we

376
00:12:32,000 --> 00:12:33,360
can change no that's all right

377
00:12:33,360 --> 00:12:38,560
i think and

378
00:12:38,560 --> 00:12:40,880
we could do here so 53 seconds maybe

379
00:12:40,880 --> 00:12:42,320
we'll do some features on the back here

380
00:12:42,320 --> 00:12:42,800
as well

381
00:12:42,800 --> 00:12:46,959
items that when i say features

382
00:12:46,959 --> 00:12:48,720
nothing magical here but let's do an

383
00:12:48,720 --> 00:12:50,079
antenna here or something

384
00:12:50,079 --> 00:12:52,800
uh scale it down there's going to be two

385
00:12:52,800 --> 00:12:53,600
antennas

386
00:12:53,600 --> 00:12:56,800
e to extrude or it's not going to be an

387
00:12:56,800 --> 00:12:58,240
antenna at all it's just a separate

388
00:12:58,240 --> 00:12:59,920
feature so now

389
00:12:59,920 --> 00:13:02,959
my i'm i've been exposed now as you can

390
00:13:02,959 --> 00:13:04,480
see i have no clue what i'm doing i'm

391
00:13:04,480 --> 00:13:04,959
just

392
00:13:04,959 --> 00:13:07,920
extruding scaling and doing weird stuff

393
00:13:07,920 --> 00:13:08,240
height

394
00:13:08,240 --> 00:13:11,920
and set e to extrude

395
00:13:14,399 --> 00:13:16,639
18 seconds should we color that on

396
00:13:16,639 --> 00:13:18,000
different

397
00:13:18,000 --> 00:13:20,000
should we make that a different color as

398
00:13:20,000 --> 00:13:21,200
well

399
00:13:21,200 --> 00:13:23,360
for some more features i've got 10

400
00:13:23,360 --> 00:13:25,120
seconds

401
00:13:25,120 --> 00:13:28,560
um just make that one a bit darker too

402
00:13:28,560 --> 00:13:33,120
and color that one a bit brighter

403
00:13:33,120 --> 00:13:36,560
and that's it 10 minutes oh i restarted

404
00:13:36,560 --> 00:13:37,279
it

405
00:13:37,279 --> 00:13:40,399
ah what am i doing

406
00:13:40,800 --> 00:13:42,240
alright guys there we have it it's a

407
00:13:42,240 --> 00:13:44,000
sci-fi tank or something of that sort

408
00:13:44,000 --> 00:13:45,440
and obviously the tracks won't really

409
00:13:45,440 --> 00:13:45,920
roll

410
00:13:45,920 --> 00:13:47,920
because uh it's more of a fixed tank so

411
00:13:47,920 --> 00:13:49,519
again for low poly stuff this should

412
00:13:49,519 --> 00:13:50,639
work pretty good

413
00:13:50,639 --> 00:13:52,320
because all i would be doing is sliding

414
00:13:52,320 --> 00:13:53,680
around um

415
00:13:53,680 --> 00:13:56,160
and you'd probably put some track marks

416
00:13:56,160 --> 00:13:57,199
behind it

417
00:13:57,199 --> 00:13:59,120
like just like a particle system that

418
00:13:59,120 --> 00:14:01,360
drops off some little tracks

419
00:14:01,360 --> 00:14:03,920
and you could separate this uh into a

420
00:14:03,920 --> 00:14:04,959
separate torrent

421
00:14:04,959 --> 00:14:07,440
but i wanted to make a sci-fi tank keep

422
00:14:07,440 --> 00:14:08,639
it quite wide

423
00:14:08,639 --> 00:14:11,519
and uh quite flat and wide i think that

424
00:14:11,519 --> 00:14:12,800
looks a little bit sci-fi

425
00:14:12,800 --> 00:14:14,320
and then all i really have time for is

426
00:14:14,320 --> 00:14:16,959
to do all of these different insets and

427
00:14:16,959 --> 00:14:18,959
extrusions and scaling that gives i

428
00:14:18,959 --> 00:14:20,720
think it gives a little bit like

429
00:14:20,720 --> 00:14:23,279
jagged features like this that adds that

430
00:14:23,279 --> 00:14:24,959
little sci-fi look without having to do

431
00:14:24,959 --> 00:14:26,480
any uv unwrapping

432
00:14:26,480 --> 00:14:28,160
and for the canon here i was a little

433
00:14:28,160 --> 00:14:29,760
bit inspired maybe by uh

434
00:14:29,760 --> 00:14:32,160
some sci-fi tanks i'm also think maybe

435
00:14:32,160 --> 00:14:32,880
even

436
00:14:32,880 --> 00:14:35,279
from what's it called starcraft 2 like a

437
00:14:35,279 --> 00:14:37,199
siege tank type of thing and i also

438
00:14:37,199 --> 00:14:38,160
wanted to have

439
00:14:38,160 --> 00:14:41,040
those uh tie fighter sides to it looks a

440
00:14:41,040 --> 00:14:42,480
little bit like a rail gun that would

441
00:14:42,480 --> 00:14:44,800
accelerate the munitions

442
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:47,760
even further or the projectile so that's

443
00:14:47,760 --> 00:14:48,480
one big

444
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:49,760
barrel though you wouldn't want to be

445
00:14:49,760 --> 00:14:51,680
shot with whatever cartridges coming out

446
00:14:51,680 --> 00:14:52,320
of the

447
00:14:52,320 --> 00:14:54,399
cartridge do you remember those

448
00:14:54,399 --> 00:14:55,360
cartridge

449
00:14:55,360 --> 00:14:57,519
used to have a spectra video msx that

450
00:14:57,519 --> 00:14:59,279
was my first computer that my dad bought

451
00:14:59,279 --> 00:15:00,800
and you put the cartridge in

452
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:02,240
had a nice feel to it when it clicked

453
00:15:02,240 --> 00:15:03,920
down into that slot and then it was

454
00:15:03,920 --> 00:15:05,360
replaced by disk drives and things like

455
00:15:05,360 --> 00:15:05,839
that

456
00:15:05,839 --> 00:15:07,760
tangent anyway if you're not happy with

457
00:15:07,760 --> 00:15:08,880
the proportions

458
00:15:08,880 --> 00:15:10,959
uh these are separate objects so if i

459
00:15:10,959 --> 00:15:12,720
press l to select that one if you wanted

460
00:15:12,720 --> 00:15:13,519
a longer barrel

461
00:15:13,519 --> 00:15:16,720
you just scale y axis and move it to

462
00:15:16,720 --> 00:15:17,519
there

463
00:15:17,519 --> 00:15:21,279
and there you have it a longer barrel

464
00:15:21,279 --> 00:15:23,519
and if you wanted to have this one maybe

465
00:15:23,519 --> 00:15:24,320
the whole tank

466
00:15:24,320 --> 00:15:26,720
wider just l to select everything and

467
00:15:26,720 --> 00:15:28,560
move it out since you're mirrored

468
00:15:28,560 --> 00:15:31,279
so you're quite free to change these

469
00:15:31,279 --> 00:15:32,639
things around even if you're

470
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:35,519
sort of finished with the tank and

471
00:15:35,519 --> 00:15:37,839
another thing you can do

472
00:15:37,839 --> 00:15:39,600
let's bring that down so i'm working

473
00:15:39,600 --> 00:15:41,519
with the same tank as before

474
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:43,120
and another thing you want to do

475
00:15:43,120 --> 00:15:45,440
obviously this is called cube because i

476
00:15:45,440 --> 00:15:47,120
started with a default cube but if we

477
00:15:47,120 --> 00:15:48,480
rename this one to

478
00:15:48,480 --> 00:15:51,839
let's do f2 and call it tank sorry cube

479
00:15:51,839 --> 00:15:53,199
i had to rename here for now

480
00:15:53,199 --> 00:15:57,040
but it's still you in the soul and

481
00:15:57,040 --> 00:15:59,040
for a game ready objects you'd have to

482
00:15:59,040 --> 00:16:00,480
separate a few things because you can't

483
00:16:00,480 --> 00:16:01,040
keep them

484
00:16:01,040 --> 00:16:02,880
the same so this turret for example i

485
00:16:02,880 --> 00:16:04,320
press l here to select the linked

486
00:16:04,320 --> 00:16:05,920
vertices here for the turret

487
00:16:05,920 --> 00:16:08,160
p and separate the selection there into

488
00:16:08,160 --> 00:16:10,000
a new object and same for this

489
00:16:10,000 --> 00:16:13,040
barrel here l p separate

490
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:15,519
selection let's select this one and call

491
00:16:15,519 --> 00:16:16,240
it

492
00:16:16,240 --> 00:16:20,240
barrel and this one is turret

493
00:16:20,240 --> 00:16:22,000
you want these as separate objects and

494
00:16:22,000 --> 00:16:23,680
you want this one to be a child of that

495
00:16:23,680 --> 00:16:25,120
object because when you rotate the

496
00:16:25,120 --> 00:16:25,600
turret

497
00:16:25,600 --> 00:16:28,639
you want the barrel to follow along with

498
00:16:28,639 --> 00:16:29,360
it

499
00:16:29,360 --> 00:16:31,680
but what we could do here is uh first of

500
00:16:31,680 --> 00:16:33,120
all i need to change the center of

501
00:16:33,120 --> 00:16:34,880
gravity here because if i rotate this

502
00:16:34,880 --> 00:16:37,120
one actually it's not too bad

503
00:16:37,120 --> 00:16:40,320
and get away with it but

504
00:16:40,320 --> 00:16:42,399
let's do a right click on this one and

505
00:16:42,399 --> 00:16:44,079
do set origin

506
00:16:44,079 --> 00:16:46,000
origin to center of mass i don't really

507
00:16:46,000 --> 00:16:47,120
know what the difference is between

508
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:48,959
surface and volume

509
00:16:48,959 --> 00:16:51,279
oh yeah you can't have the mirror

510
00:16:51,279 --> 00:16:52,880
modifier on

511
00:16:52,880 --> 00:16:55,360
when you do that because uh it breaks

512
00:16:55,360 --> 00:16:57,519
the mirror modifier can i do

513
00:16:57,519 --> 00:17:00,720
set origin to geometry

514
00:17:00,720 --> 00:17:02,480
so this is a problem because it sets the

515
00:17:02,480 --> 00:17:04,640
center of this object into here

516
00:17:04,640 --> 00:17:06,799
which is not so good so i'll probably

517
00:17:06,799 --> 00:17:08,000
what i'll do here is i'll

518
00:17:08,000 --> 00:17:10,400
select this one press h to hide it tab

519
00:17:10,400 --> 00:17:12,240
into edit mode

520
00:17:12,240 --> 00:17:15,280
select this face here shift s cursor to

521
00:17:15,280 --> 00:17:16,480
selected

522
00:17:16,480 --> 00:17:18,720
and i probably want to slide it further

523
00:17:18,720 --> 00:17:20,480
back here let's pick that vertex

524
00:17:20,480 --> 00:17:22,720
and do shift s cursor to select it maybe

525
00:17:22,720 --> 00:17:23,679
there

526
00:17:23,679 --> 00:17:25,679
and now i can tab out of that one right

527
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:27,199
click set origin

528
00:17:27,199 --> 00:17:29,840
origin to 3d cursor and now when we

529
00:17:29,840 --> 00:17:31,600
rotate this one let's do alt h

530
00:17:31,600 --> 00:17:35,200
to unhide rotate z that's a pretty good

531
00:17:35,200 --> 00:17:38,640
rotation for that one so rotate

532
00:17:38,640 --> 00:17:42,240
that yeah and now we also need to

533
00:17:42,240 --> 00:17:45,520
select this barrel here barrel or barrel

534
00:17:45,520 --> 00:17:49,760
is it like this is it barrel

535
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:53,440
barrel of a gun barrel must be barrel so

536
00:17:53,440 --> 00:17:55,679
for this one we could just go to here

537
00:17:55,679 --> 00:17:56,960
and do

538
00:17:56,960 --> 00:17:58,960
child of constraints actually first of

539
00:17:58,960 --> 00:18:00,400
all let's change the

540
00:18:00,400 --> 00:18:03,280
central mass on this one too then we'll

541
00:18:03,280 --> 00:18:04,960
hide this one

542
00:18:04,960 --> 00:18:08,080
i'm going to keep that here so shift s

543
00:18:08,080 --> 00:18:11,200
cursor to selected tab right click set

544
00:18:11,200 --> 00:18:11,760
origin

545
00:18:11,760 --> 00:18:15,039
origin to 3d cursor now alt h to unhide

546
00:18:15,039 --> 00:18:16,480
that one

547
00:18:16,480 --> 00:18:18,320
yes now we can go to the object

548
00:18:18,320 --> 00:18:19,840
constraint tab here

549
00:18:19,840 --> 00:18:23,360
add child of pick

550
00:18:23,360 --> 00:18:24,880
the turrets and then we have the set

551
00:18:24,880 --> 00:18:26,880
inverse there and now when we rotate

552
00:18:26,880 --> 00:18:29,600
this one the barrel will follow along

553
00:18:29,600 --> 00:18:30,240
also when

554
00:18:30,240 --> 00:18:35,120
this uh bad boy or bad girl bad lady

555
00:18:35,120 --> 00:18:37,360
when it shoots i usually animate a

556
00:18:37,360 --> 00:18:38,559
little recoil here

557
00:18:38,559 --> 00:18:40,559
so i'd recommend that for a firing

558
00:18:40,559 --> 00:18:42,480
animation if we do shift space

559
00:18:42,480 --> 00:18:46,559
g you just basically do that

560
00:18:46,559 --> 00:18:48,799
looks pretty cool when it shoots so just

561
00:18:48,799 --> 00:18:50,080
the whole thing recoil so you could

562
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:51,360
actually even separate these

563
00:18:51,360 --> 00:18:53,919
uh rail gun side objects into separate

564
00:18:53,919 --> 00:18:55,440
ones and just maybe the center piece

565
00:18:55,440 --> 00:18:56,480
goes in and out

566
00:18:56,480 --> 00:18:58,160
all right so time has come for the bonus

567
00:18:58,160 --> 00:18:59,919
tip of this video and

568
00:18:59,919 --> 00:19:01,919
someone suggested in the chat i think a

569
00:19:01,919 --> 00:19:03,280
couple of premieres ago

570
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:05,120
something really nifty and unfortunately

571
00:19:05,120 --> 00:19:07,120
i don't remember the name of the person

572
00:19:07,120 --> 00:19:08,720
so apologies for that but i want to

573
00:19:08,720 --> 00:19:10,080
bring the tip up and hopefully i can

574
00:19:10,080 --> 00:19:11,840
give you a credit in the future

575
00:19:11,840 --> 00:19:14,480
but when i've created new geometry or a

576
00:19:14,480 --> 00:19:16,240
new object here let's say we have

577
00:19:16,240 --> 00:19:18,960
we're in object mode here so let's have

578
00:19:18,960 --> 00:19:21,120
nothing selected and i do shift a

579
00:19:21,120 --> 00:19:23,360
and then i add a cube here and you can

580
00:19:23,360 --> 00:19:24,720
see that this one doesn't have this

581
00:19:24,720 --> 00:19:26,000
texture enabled so

582
00:19:26,000 --> 00:19:27,760
i've in the past i have gone into

583
00:19:27,760 --> 00:19:29,440
shading here and then i've selected the

584
00:19:29,440 --> 00:19:31,440
objects and i've selected the material

585
00:19:31,440 --> 00:19:33,679
selected it like this and then switched

586
00:19:33,679 --> 00:19:35,840
back to my editing tab just to get this

587
00:19:35,840 --> 00:19:37,840
here there's a much better way here so

588
00:19:37,840 --> 00:19:40,320
i'll delete let's see i'll

589
00:19:40,320 --> 00:19:43,360
delete this one add it again shift a

590
00:19:43,360 --> 00:19:45,039
add the cube and see here it's got

591
00:19:45,039 --> 00:19:47,360
nothing so i select this one first

592
00:19:47,360 --> 00:19:49,919
and i shift select this tank afterwards

593
00:19:49,919 --> 00:19:50,960
i'll do control

594
00:19:50,960 --> 00:19:54,000
l and then make link to material and

595
00:19:54,000 --> 00:19:54,400
then

596
00:19:54,400 --> 00:19:56,400
this one gets that material so that's a

597
00:19:56,400 --> 00:19:57,760
much much faster way

598
00:19:57,760 --> 00:19:59,760
to get all the objects or all the new

599
00:19:59,760 --> 00:20:01,760
objects to share the same material

600
00:20:01,760 --> 00:20:03,280
instead of having to go into the shading

601
00:20:03,280 --> 00:20:04,799
tab so thank you very much

602
00:20:04,799 --> 00:20:06,720
i'm actually gonna look up so the

603
00:20:06,720 --> 00:20:08,320
freshest was one of the guys apparently

604
00:20:08,320 --> 00:20:09,520
in the comments a couple of weeks ago

605
00:20:09,520 --> 00:20:11,120
that suggested this to control

606
00:20:11,120 --> 00:20:13,360
l to link materials from active so

607
00:20:13,360 --> 00:20:14,799
thanks the freshest

608
00:20:14,799 --> 00:20:16,799
maybe it was someone else as well in the

609
00:20:16,799 --> 00:20:18,559
in the live chat that suggested this so

610
00:20:18,559 --> 00:20:19,360
sorry for not

611
00:20:19,360 --> 00:20:20,640
mentioning your name but i really

612
00:20:20,640 --> 00:20:22,320
appreciate this one it's a much faster

613
00:20:22,320 --> 00:20:22,640
way

614
00:20:22,640 --> 00:20:23,919
alright guys i hope you enjoyed that

615
00:20:23,919 --> 00:20:25,280
video it was a lot of fun to make a

616
00:20:25,280 --> 00:20:26,720
little bit of a sci-fi tank hopefully

617
00:20:26,720 --> 00:20:27,919
i'll get my gears together

618
00:20:27,919 --> 00:20:30,159
and get back into cranking out some

619
00:20:30,159 --> 00:20:31,919
objects and watch out for that live

620
00:20:31,919 --> 00:20:33,039
stream that i'm going to be doing it's

621
00:20:33,039 --> 00:20:34,000
going to be a lot of fun

622
00:20:34,000 --> 00:20:36,960
and a lot of coffee so i keep remember

623
00:20:36,960 --> 00:20:39,280
the next saturday after i hit 100k

624
00:20:39,280 --> 00:20:41,120
subscribers i'm going to do the 24 hour

625
00:20:41,120 --> 00:20:42,240
live stream and

626
00:20:42,240 --> 00:20:45,360
scream 20 24 hour live stream that's

627
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:46,400
going to be something

628
00:20:46,400 --> 00:20:48,880
no live stream and i'll be cranking out

629
00:20:48,880 --> 00:20:50,960
a lot of low poly characters that and

630
00:20:50,960 --> 00:20:52,559
animate them as well i'll do a whole

631
00:20:52,559 --> 00:20:54,400
bunch of characters i've thought of some

632
00:20:54,400 --> 00:20:56,080
stupid names for them all

633
00:20:56,080 --> 00:20:57,360
so i'm just going to be going through

634
00:20:57,360 --> 00:20:59,520
the list and making one by one by one by

635
00:20:59,520 --> 00:20:59,840
one

636
00:20:59,840 --> 00:21:02,080
and then i'll just uh yeah see where it

637
00:21:02,080 --> 00:21:03,039
takes me

638
00:21:03,039 --> 00:21:05,200

you're

641
00:21:07,440 --> 00:21:09,600
able to provide through my patreon page

642
00:21:09,600 --> 00:21:10,720
and for those

643
00:21:10,720 --> 00:21:12,559
i add these models so you can download

644
00:21:12,559 --> 00:21:14,559
them likes a little bit behind but i'll

645
00:21:14,559 --> 00:21:16,720
bulk add them and i'll be batching a few

646
00:21:16,720 --> 00:21:18,240
more objects together from the most

647
00:21:18,240 --> 00:21:20,320
recent 10-minute builds there for the

648
00:21:20,320 --> 00:21:22,240
patreon downloads give it a thumbs up if
